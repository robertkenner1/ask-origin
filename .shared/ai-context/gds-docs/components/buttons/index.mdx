# Buttons

Effective use of buttons is crucial to a frictionless user experience. There are several styles available and guidance to help you decide which is best for your use case.

## Usage

- Button, with a text label and optional icon, is your go-to option for most actions.
- ButtonAsLink visually looks like a Button—but functions like a Link, allowing for navigation among pages or URLs.
- Icon Button should be reserved only for use in compact surfaces.

## Button options

Further guidance is available in each doc.
