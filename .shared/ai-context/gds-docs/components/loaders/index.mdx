# Loaders

A loader can take different visual styles based on context.

## Usage

- Skeleton Loader provides a visual presentation of the expected information hierarchy.
- Circular Loader indicates loading content or an action in progress when an approximation of visual presentation is unhelpful.
- Branded Loader enhances a full-page loading experience with a branded element.
- Dotted Loader (not planned) represents typing in progress, like in the context of a chatbot.

## Loader options

Further guidance is available in each doc.
