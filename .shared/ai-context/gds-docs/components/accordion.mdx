# Accordion

<span>
  An Accordion is a container that can be expanded to reveal additional content or collapsed to hide
  the content.
</span>

<ComponentStatusRow name="Accordion" />

<Hero
  path={useBaseUrl("/img/components/accordion_hero.svg")}
  altText="A Modal showing a collapsed Accordion list and an introduction to Consent Management."
/>
<p className="caption">
  An Accordion is used in the Consent Management introduction screen to show summaries about how
  Grammarly handles user data.
</p>

## Usage

**Use when:**

- Organizing content into collapsible sections. For example, FAQs or other groups of information that aren't essential and may be hidden.
- Grouping related information, such as product specifications or step-by-step instructions, into collapsible sections for better readability.

**Do not use when:**

- Providing critical information that must remain visible.
- The content is brief and doesn't require organization. In these cases, an Accordion may add unnecessary complexity.

## Anatomy

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/accordion_anatomy.svg")}
    alt="Anatomy diagram of a Accordion"
  />
</div>
<ol className="diagram-legend small">
  <li>Header icon (optional)</li>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Arrow icon</li>
  <li>Content</li>
</ol>

## Examples​

### Default

- All Accordions should be in a collapsed state by default.
- All Accordions are expandable and collapsible.
- The included arrow points down when the Accordion container is closed, and it points up when the container is open.

### Size

Accordions are available in sizes `small`, `medium`, and `large`. Size `medium` is the default.

### Background color

### With icons

Use the `iconStart` prop to add an icon from the Iconography library at the start of an item’s label.
It is recommended to use icons on either all or none of the items.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Flex width="50%">
    <Accordion>
        <Accordion.Item iconStart={ConsentSafeIcon} title="We’ll keep your data safe">
            <Text as="p">

            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Item iconStart={ConsentTransparentIcon} title="We're transparent about data">
            <Text as="p">
            When you use Grammarly, we’ll collect and store some data, such as:
                <ul>

                    <li>Your commonly used words and phrases</li>
                    <li>Your email address</li>
                    <li>Applications and websites where you use Grammarly</li>
                </ul>
                Information about what data is needed for each tailored assistance feature can be found by clicking the link under each feature in your account settings. You can see the data associated with your account by requesting a personal data report. 
            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

### Width

By default, each Accordion has a dynamic width based on the width of the parent container.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
  <Flex width={400}>
    <Accordion>
        <Accordion.Item title="We’ll keep your data safe">

            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Item title="We're transparent about data">
            <Text as="p">
            When you use Grammarly, we’ll collect and store some data, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>The text you write and check using Grammarly</li>
                    <li>Your commonly used words and phrases</li>
                    <li>Your email address</li>
                    <li>Applications and websites where you use Grammarly</li>

            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

### Arrow icon position

By default, the arrow icon appears at the right of the container.
Alternatively, use the Accordion item property `arrowPosition=inline` to position the arrow inline with the end of the text. This is ideal for cases where a single accordion is used.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
  <Flex direction="row" gap={4} width="100%" justify="start" align="start">

        <Accordion.Item title="We’ll keep your data safe">

                    <li>Your email address</li>

        </Accordion.Item>

### Separators

By default, each Accordion Item in a list, except for the last one, has a bottom separator. Borders may be removed with `hasSeparators={false}`.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Flex width={400}>
    <Accordion hasSeparators={false}>
        <Accordion.Item title="We’ll keep your data safe">

            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Item title="We're transparent about data">
            <Text as="p">
            When you use Grammarly, we’ll collect and store some data, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>The text you write and check using Grammarly</li>
                    <li>Your commonly used words and phrases</li>
                    <li>Your email address</li>
                    <li>Applications and websites where you use Grammarly</li>

            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

### Open by default

An Accordion item can be open by default using the `isExpanded` prop.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Flex width={400}>
    <Accordion>
        <Accordion.Item isExpanded title="We’ll keep your data safe">
            <Text as="p">

            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Item title="We're transparent about data">
            <Text as="p">
            When you use Grammarly, we’ll collect and store some data, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>The text you write and check using Grammarly</li>
                    <li>Your commonly used words and phrases</li>
                    <li>Your email address</li>
                    <li>Applications and websites where you use Grammarly</li>

                Information about what data is needed for each tailored assistance feature can be found by clicking the link under each feature in your account settings. You can see the data associated with your account by requesting a personal data report. 
            </Text>
        </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

## Behavior

### Vertical scroll

If an Accordion expands to be taller than the available height:

- On a regular page, the page scrolls to accommodate the content including expanded Accordion containers.
- In a smaller container like the Mac/Win Onboarding window, the parent container would scroll.

_Note: Never add a scroll within an Accordion itself._

## Accessibility

### Keyboard interaction​

| Key                                  | Expected result                                                                                                                                                                             |

| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                       | When focus moves into the Accordion list, it focuses on the active Accordion element. <br /><br />In an Accordion list, focus moves sequentially through the Accordions from top to bottom. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Expands or collapses the focused Accordion.                                                                                                                                                 |

## Writing

- There is no minimum or maximum width for the content of a Accordion panel.
- We recommend a width of 45–85 characters as a baseline. This corresponds to the most commonly recommended range for web-content line length. Aspire to make the information in the Accordion panel as scannable and easy to read as possible.
- Avoid situations where UI elements seem distant from each other.
- If an H1 exists on the page, use another heading size like H2 or H3 in the Accordion panel. [Learn more about using headers to create information hierarchy](/components/heading#information-hierarchy).
