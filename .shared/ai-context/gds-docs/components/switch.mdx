# Switch

<span>A Switch has two possible states: on and off.</span>

<ComponentStatusRow name="Switch" />
<Hero
  path={useBaseUrl("/img/components/switch_hero.svg")}
  altText="Switches control the ability to turn on tone detection and automatic corrections in a Modal for Settings."

<p class="caption">
  Switches control the ability to turn on tone detection and automatic corrections in a Modal for
  Settings.
</p>

## Usage

**Use when:**

- There is a choice to turn a single item on or off.
- The choice isn’t affected by other options.
- The state change takes effect immediately without the need for an additional Button to save changes.

**Do not use when:**

- A user needs to give their consent, such as when accepting terms and conditions. Instead, use a [Checkbox](/components/checkbox).
- A user can select options that take effect only after activating a Button that saves changes. Instead, use a [Checkbox](/components/checkbox) or [Radio Group](/components/radio-group).
- The option can be determined by other options, or turning on one option would turn off another in the same list. Instead, use a [Radio Group](/components/radio-group) or [Radio Button Group](/components/radio-button-group).
- A user can choose between two options other than on and off. For example, choosing to download a document as either a PDF or CSV file. Instead, use a [Radio Group](/components/radio-group) or [Radio Button Group](/components/radio-button-group).

### macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android

When necessary, a native Switch can be used on macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android. It will behave according to the rules set by the operating system. The design on these platforms does not need to match the web component, but you can use design system tokens to style it. [View the design tokens](/tokens).

## Anatomy

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/switch_anatomy.svg")} alt="Anatomy diagram of a Switch" />
</div>
<ol class="diagram-legend small">
  <li>Label</li>
  <li>Toggle</li>
  <li>Helper text (optional)</li>
</ol>

## Examples

### Default

By default, a Switch includes a `label` displayed to the left of the toggle. The spacing between the label and toggle varies based on the width of the label and overall container.

<ComponentPlayground scope={{ Switch }} code={`<Switch label="Snippets" />`} />

### Size

Use the `size` prop to scale the Switch control and its label. Size `medium` is the default.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
  <Flex gap={3} direction="column" width={200}>
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      size="small"
    />
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      size="medium"
    />
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      size="large"
    />
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      size="xlarge"
    />
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

### Right label

Use `labelDisplay="right"` to display the label on the right side of the toggle. Spacing is fixed at 8px between the label and toggle.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      labelDisplay="right"
    />
  `}
/>

### Top label

Use `labelDisplay="top"` to display the label above the toggle.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      labelDisplay="top"
    />
  `}
/>

### Hidden label

Use `labelDisplay="hidden"` to display the toggle without a visible label. A label is still required for people using a screen reader. [Learn about accessibility for hidden labels](#hidden-labels).

The width of a Switch with a hidden label is the width of the toggle.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Switch
      label="Snippets"
      labelDisplay="hidden"
    />
  `}
/>

### With helper text

Use `helperMessage` to provide additional details beyond the label of a Switch. Helper text always appears directly below the label, regardless of the label’s position.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
<Flex gap={4} wrap width={480}>
  <Switch
    helperMessage="View, insert, and create snippets wherever you write using keyboard shortcuts."
    label="Snippets"
    labelDisplay="left"
  />
  <Switch
    helperMessage="View, insert, and create snippets wherever you write using keyboard shortcuts."
    label="Snippets"
    labelDisplay="right"
  />
  <Switch
    helperMessage="View, insert, and create snippets wherever you write using keyboard shortcuts."
    label="Snippets"
    labelDisplay="top"
  />
</Flex>
`}
/>

### Default selection

Specify `defaultSelected` to indicate a Switch is on when it is first presented to a user.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Switch
      defaultSelected
      helperMessage="View, insert, and create snippets wherever you write using keyboard shortcuts."
      label="Snippets"
    />
  `}
/>

### Events

The `onChange` event is called whenever a Switch is turned on or off.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`function ControlledSwitchExample() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <Switch
    label="Snippets"
      isSelected={selected}
      onChange={(isSelected) => {
        setSelected(isSelected)
        alert("Your selection was saved.")
      }}
    />
  );
  }`}
/>

### Disabled

Use `isDisabled` to indicate that a user cannot focus, change, or interact with a Switch.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Switch
      isDisabled
      helperMessage="View, insert, and create snippets wherever you write using keyboard shortcuts."
      label="Snippets"
    />
 `}
/>

## Behavior

### Width

The width of a Switch with a hidden label is the width of the toggle.

For Switches with a visible label, the Switch fills the width of its container up to a maximum of 480px. The label and helper text can wrap to a second line once the container or maximum width is reached.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/switch_max_width.svg")}
    alt="Three Switches are shown at a width of 480px, the maximum allowed. The examples demonstrate the maximum width for right, left, and top label variants."
  />
</div>

### Click area

A user can click or tap anywhere on the label, helper message, toggle, or space between them to change the state of a Switch.

### Immediate effect

The effects of turning a Switch on or off are immediate. There is no need for an additional Button to save the selection.

### No error state

A Switch does not have an error state because it is always either on or off, both of which are valid states.

If other errors or issues arise, such as an issue with internet connectivity, deliver this information in a [Toast](/components/toast) or a [Modal](/components/modal), depending on the appropriate level of urgency and intrusion.

## Accessibility

### Status changes

When an `onChange` event occurs, status changes and any additional content or elements that appear must be announced for people using a screen reader. For example, a user needs to be made aware that a set of Checkboxes has appeared after activating a Switch.

Write the announcement to explain what just happened and name where a user can interact with new content or elements.

In the coded example we've provided, the announcement explains that toppings are either displayed or no longer available to add on. The new section is named "Add toppings" and the language aligns across both the announcement and legend so they're clearly related. You don't need to announce the individual Checkboxes because they will be read at the contextually relevant time after a user has moved focus into the Checkbox Group.

<ComponentPlayground
  scope={{ VisuallyHidden, useBaseUrl }}
  code={`function SwitchStatusChangeExample() {
    // State for the Switch
    const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);

    // States for the Checkboxes
    const [almonds, setAlmonds] = React.useState(false);
    const [bananas, setBananas] = React.useState(false);

    // State that indicates whether the status-changes section should include content.
    // When the component is initially loaded or when the user interacts with a Checkbox,
    // the status-changes section should not include content.
    const [statusChanges, setStatusChanges] = React.useState(false);

    return (

              }}
            />

        </VisuallyHidden>
      </>

);
}`}

### Hidden labels

A Switch’s label can only be plain text. In some cases, you may require custom styling beyond what’s available as part of the component. For example, you might want to add Tags to classify different Switches. This requires visually hiding a Switch’s label and adding a separate Text and Tag component nearby.

A `label` is still required, but `labelDisplay="hidden"` can be used to visually hide the label while maintaining accessibility for people using screen readers. Add an `onClick` event handler to the external, visible text that acts as the label so that it will toggle the Switch's state as intended.

<ComponentPlayground
  scope={{ VisuallyHidden, useBaseUrl }}
  code={`function SwitchStatusChangeExample() {
    // State for "Disable Switch with custom label" Switch
    const [disabled, setDisabled] = React.useState(false);

    // State for the Switch with custom label
    const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);

    return (
      <Flex direction="column" gap={4}>
        <Switch
          label="Disable Switch with custom label"
          isSelected={disabled}
          onChange={setDisabled}
          helperMessage="Disable the Switch with the custom label to see disabled style and behavior that should be implemented"
        />

        <Flex gap={2} justify="space-between">
          <Flex
            direction="column"
            gap={1}
            style={{ cursor: disabled ? 'not-allowed' : 'pointer' }}
          >
            <Text

              onClick={() => {
                if (!disabled) {
                  setSelected(!selected);
                }
              }}

            label="Switch with custom label (beta)"
            isSelected={selected}
            isDisabled={disabled}
            onChange={setSelected}
            labelDisplay="hidden"
            aria-describedby="custom-label-helper"
          />
        </Flex>
      </Flex>
    );
}`}
/>


### Keyboard interaction

| Key              | Expected result                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>   | Moves focus into the Switch.                |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Activates the toggle and changes the state. |

## Writing

We aim to keep a consistent writing style across components within [Forms](/patterns/forms).

### Referring to state changes

With a well-considered label, a Switch should be so intuitive that no additional explanation is necessary to understand how to interact with it. If such an explanation is required to make sense of the experience, reconsider the label’s wording or whether another component might better match our users’ expectations. Avoid explaining how to use a Switch in UI content.

Because Switches are used to control functionality across Grammarly’s product offerings, in some cases it’s necessary to redirect a user to another location to change the state of a Switch. For example, you may need to direct a user to turn on a new feature while using the desktop assistant.

Do not use _toggle_ as a noun or verb. Avoid using the verb _switch_ in this context, too. Instead, use language that identifies turning an option on or off.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/switch_writing_state_changes.svg")}
    alt="An empty state explains that a feature, Style, is turned off. There is a Button that says 'Open Settings' with an arrow pointing to the Settings menu a user would be taken to. A mouse hand cursor hovers over the corresponding Switch in the Settings menu."
  />
</div>
<p class="caption">
  An empty state in the assistant prompts a user to turn on a feature that detects writing style.
  Because a user’s explicit permission is needed, they are taken to Settings, where the Switch
  controlling the feature is displayed.
</p>

### Labels

Labels help a user scan the various inputs in a Form. A label should describe the purpose of an individual input while clearly distinguishing each input from one another.

### Helper text

Helper text takes different forms to fit specific needs. Some tell a user what to do using action verbs, while others define terms and requirements with punchy fragments of information.
