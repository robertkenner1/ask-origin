# Punctuation

**Punctuation** means the set of symbols used to separate and clarify the meaning of sentences and written elements. This section is organized alphabetically and applies to content in product UI.

For a full breakdown of Grammarly’s approach to grammar and usage in other external-facing content, visit the <Link href="https://coda.io/d/Grammarly-Style-Guide_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarly-Style-Guide_suVxisx4">Grammarly Company Style Guide</Link>.

## A note about punctuation and accessibility

Screen readers interpret punctuation and use it to change their inflection—introducing pauses when reading content aloud, just like you would.

This presents a challenge, though, when accounting for punctuation in the Grammarly product’s suggestions. The characters from a user’s text should be referenced as subjects in the sentence with proper names like “comma” or “period.”

However, punctuation is often not announced this way because the screen reader defaults to inflection. In practice, this means that when we suggest inserting or removing a comma, the screen reader would typically pause without announcing the character's name.

We solve for this by adding a label to the characters for screen readers so it announces them as proper nouns by name, improving the quality and comprehension of suggestions.

## Ampersands 

Don’t use ampersands when unnecessary (_&_ instead of _and_). Would spelling out the word _and_ work just as well? If the answer is yes, spell it out.

Because of limited space in product (particularly on mobile), ampersands can be OK if we need to save space—but don’t overdo it. Only choose this option if there is no other way to save space. 

When using ampersands, be mindful of how they can make something seem like a proper noun (think “Procter & Gamble”). This could unintentionally misrepresent something as a Grammarly product when it isn’t. 

When using ampersands in a series, do not use the Oxford comma.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Read about our user-first approach to privacy & security in our Trust Center.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "View stats under Days Active & Last Activity. [This makes it seem like one heading when we are really referring to two.]",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "​​View your weekly writing insights, monitor your progress over time & access resources to help you improve your writing.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Adhere to APA, MLA & Chicago citation styles. [This could make it seem like “MLA & Chicago” is one entity.]",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "​​Dictionary and language settings",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Dictionary & Language settings",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Colons

Do not use colons in headings. (Do not use any end punctuation except _?_ or _!_ in headings.)

Going against Grammarly’s usual adherence to Chicago style, we capitalize a new sentence after a colon, even when it’s only a single sentence. (_This is to say: The company is going to grow a billion-fold by the year 2323._) If the clause following a colon is not a complete sentence, do not capitalize.

## Commas and Oxford commas

Grammarly uses the Oxford comma in lists of three or more items.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Lions, tigers, and bears.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Lions, tigers and bears.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

We consider the comma splice an error. Comma splices are when sentences or independent clauses are improperly connected by a comma—in these cases, we should consider proper punctuation such as a period, semicolon, colon, or conjunction.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Your account is activated, and your card will be charged annually.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Your account is activated; your card will be charged annually.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Your account is activated and your card will be charged annually.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Watch out for comma use with nonessential clauses vs. essential clauses; comma misuse can make something inaccurate. Nonessential clauses provide information that, while interesting, does not change the main point of a sentence. 

In the example below, placing commas between “Sesame Street resident” and “Elmo” communicates that Elmo is Sesame Street’s _only_ resident, which is incorrect. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Sesame Street resident Elmo is learning about tax law.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Sesame Street resident, Elmo, is learning about tax law.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Similarly, placing commas around “in Berlin” makes it seem like there is one hub at Grammarly, which is incorrect.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Grammarly’s hub in Berlin is hiring for engineering, product, and design roles.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Grammarly’s hub, in Berlin, is hiring for engineering, product, and design roles.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Also in the same vein, commas in the incorrect version make it seem like brand tones is the _only_ product feature.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Grammarly’s brand tones feature makes it easy for teams to hit the right note.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Grammarly’s feature, brand tones, makes it easy for teams to hit the right note.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Ellipses

Ellipses can be used to indicate an intentional omission from a text or an action in progress.

Format ellipses in interface text as the horizontal ellipsis Unicode character “…” That's three periods all in a row. Insert a space between the ellipsis and any adjacent text. In HTML, the code for a horizontal ellipsis is `&hellip;`.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Reviewing your text …",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Reviewing your text . . . [Has spaces between periods]",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Reviewing your text ... [This is three periods instead of the Unicode character]",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

This format is recommended because:

- Screen readers do not reliably announce other ellipses styles, for instance, three spaced periods in a row (also known as Chicago Manual of Style ellipses) 
- A space between a word and an ellipsis results in the most accurate recognition and announcement of the ellipsis

Avoid ellipses and present participles in Button labels.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Save changes",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Save changes …",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**An exception:** In Windows, ellipses are used on buttons when the action is not terminal. For example, [Print …] opens a properties dialog where the user can specify the number of copies, page size, and the like, while [Print] commits the print job and sends it to the print queue. 

## Em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens

### Em dash

Use caution when considering an em dash in product content. 

Em dashes can be used to:
- Set off parenthetical information (words added to a sentence that don’t change the meaning or grammar of the original sentence)
- Set off an appositive (a noun or pronoun, often with modifiers, set beside another noun or pronoun to explain or identify it) that contains commas
- Direct readers to a list
- Mark sharp turns in thought 

Do not use single or double hyphens in place of an em dash. Likewise, do not switch back and forth between spaced en dashes and em dashes. When writing in a short space, it’s best to use an em dash with spaces around it ( — ) to allow words to break naturally. 

### En dash

En dashes are used for ranges, such as numbers and dates. Use a space on either side.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "1 – 2 pm",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "March 3 – April 14",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "1-2 pm [this is a hyphen]",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "1–2 pm [this needs spaces]",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "1 — 2 pm [this is an em dash]",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Hyphens

Use a hyphen for compound modifiers, that is two words that act together to modify a noun. For example, “two-factor authentication.”

## Exclamation points

Avoid exclamation points in the UI. You have to _really_ earn the exuberance and extravagance.

Ask yourself if the moment is truly that celebratory or if there’s a good reason for over-excitement and over-emphasis. If so, proceed with caution—do not use an excessive number of exclamation points. If not, use a period or omit end punctuation instead.

## Periods and end punctuation 

### In headings

Do not use end punctuation in headings unless it is _!_ or _?_ [Learn how to format headings](/content/style/formatting#headings-and-titles).

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">
          Writing Sessions Improved
        </Heading>
      ),
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">
          Writing Sessions Improved.
        </Heading>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">
          Your team used Grammarly to improve 66.6% of their writing sessions
        </Heading>
      ),
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">
          Your team used Grammarly to improve 66.6% of their writing sessions.
        </Heading>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

In this example, an exclamation point adds appropriate emphasis to a greeting in a heading, but omitting end punctuation would work too, depending on how warm or bold you want to be.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">Hello from Grammarly!</Heading>
      ),
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">Hello from Grammarly</Heading>
      ),
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">Hello from Grammarly.</Heading>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### In interface elements and body text

In labels and [Buttons](/components/button), do not use end punctuation.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Send",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Send.",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Send!",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Otherwise, reduce punctuation use when possible, but maintain end punctuation when it makes sense—for instance, to distinguish two sentences or fragments. Try to use periods instead of semicolons, dashes, conjunctions, or anything else that makes sentence structure more complex.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Add a predefined term",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Add a predefined term.",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "Select an add-on adventure for your visit. You’ll pick a time in the next step.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Select an add on adventure for your visit You’ll pick a time in the next step",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "Review more suggestions in Grammarly",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Review more suggestions—in Grammarly; We're your AI writing assistant.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**An exception:** Error messages always take a period at the end.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "This field is required.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "This field is required",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### In abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms

We do not use periods in most acronyms or initialisms in product content. For further guidance:
- [Learn how to format abbreviations](/content/style/formatting#abbreviations)
- [Visit our terminology list](/content/terminology) and search for the term you're wondering about

## Quotation marks and apostrophes

Always use curly quotation marks and apostrophes (or “smart” quotation marks and apostrophes) in all text when possible. 

### Apostrophes

Use apostrophes for forming contractions, possessives, and abbreviations. Rarely, they can also be used to form a plural (for instance when we are pluralizing individual lowercase letters).

Here are some examples of common phrases and circumstances that have apostrophes:

- Abbreviating years: Pay close attention to curly quotes to ensure they’re facing to the left (away from the year), and not toward the year (example: 1999 would be ’99).
- bachelor’s degree, master’s degree
- Dos and don’ts (note that there is no apostrophe in “dos”)
- Dot the i’s and cross the t’s

### Quotation marks

Put commas, periods, question marks, and exclamation points inside quotation marks. Put semicolons outside of quotation marks.

**Do not use** quotation marks for emphasis, to highlight keywords, or to refer to UI text. 

Instead, use a **bold** font weight to indicate importance and draw attention to something. When referring to UI elements within the product, we also use bold to indicate that the text is repeating a visible UI label. [Learn how to write about UI elements](/content/style/formatting#mentioning-ui-elements).
