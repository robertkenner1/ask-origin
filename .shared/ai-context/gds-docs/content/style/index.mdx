# Style

**Style** means the set of practices and standards that we follow when writing. We set these standards because, as Grammarly, our writing is held to our own high standards. The style guidance within GDS is curated to address common use cases in UX content.

For a full breakdown of Grammarly’s approach to grammar and usage in other external-facing content, visit the <Link href="https://coda.io/d/Grammarly-Style-Guide_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarly-Style-Guide_suVxisx4">Grammarly Company Style Guide</Link>.
