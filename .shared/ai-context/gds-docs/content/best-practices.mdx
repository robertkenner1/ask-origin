# Best practices

Words mean unique things—each one of them. Wild, right? Language _is_ kind of wild.

The right words can disambiguate components and pages from one another. They turn interactions and behavior into specific solutions. They draw attention to identifiable concepts that match a user’s wants and needs.

Apply these guiding principles when choosing words and writing phrases for Grammarly’s product offerings.

## Be concise

### Use simple sentences

Strive for simple sentence constructions. Avoid walls of text that require scrolling.

### Say only what matters most

Overexplanations tend to slow users down. Cut what’s unnecessary or excessive. A simple, condensed explanation is usually better than a complete but complex one.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Manage your devices and review recent activity to help keep your account secure.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content:
        "In the settings below, you can see all of the devices where you’re signed in. You can also look at recent sign ins and outs, when they happened, and where they happened. This data is meant to help you understand the risks of using the internet and give you confidence that your account is secure or help you find ways to fix insecurities.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Consider the whole problem

If you feel you need an overly complex explanation or set of instructions, consider that this may indicate a design flaw. For instance, is your user flow as efficient as it could be?

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Choose a flavor",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="p">
          To choose a flavor, first click on the <Text as="strong">Open dropdown</Text> button.
          Then, use the up and down arrow buttons on the screen (do not use your keyboard keys) to
          navigate the list of options. Finally, click <Text as="strong">Choose item</Text> to
          confirm the highlighted selection from the list.
        </Text>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Be clear

### Set up content for scanning

Format and display information strategically. People often read by scanning, so make it easy for them.

### Write for 7th-grade readers

Assume your reader has a seventh-grade reading level and has the least possible context for what you’re trying to tell them. Is the text written so simply that it’s immediately understandable without any lengthy clarification?

### Prefer what's most familiar

Rely on existing concepts, terms, and words before inventing new ones to describe something. This helps us write simply and for the widest possible audience. Portmanteaus and neologisms often require larger investments in marketing and education to be understood by users. Remember to keep codenames confidential.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="p">
          <Text as="strong">Knowledge Share</Text> helps your team decode terms and acronyms.
        </Text>
      ),
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="p">
          <Text as="strong">Knowledgely</Text> is a new feature that un-termifies your terms and
          de-acronymizes your acronyms.
        </Text>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="p">
          <Text as="strong">Project Porcupine</Text> features help your team decode terms and
          acronyms.
        </Text>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="p">
          <Text as="strong">K-Now Let's Share</Text> helps your team decode terms and acronyms.
        </Text>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Use technical terms strategically

Choose plain language over jargon but maintain technical terms strategically when they have specific meaning to the intended audience.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Check grammar, clarity, and correctness",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Check GEC categories",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "Use the Oxford comma",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Add a comma before the last item in a list of three or more things",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Maintain our established style

### Use sentence case

Write in sentence case. It helps our users scan information at a glance.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "This is sentence case.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "THIS IS ALL CAPS. (IT’S NOT ACCESSIBLE, BY THE WAY.)",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content:
        "Title Casing Looks Official But Is Tougher for Our Brains to Digest in Large Chunks, Which Is Why Most UI Text Is in Sentence Case—and Why Things Like Billboards Are Often in Title Casing.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Be consistent

Apply a principle of consistency in lists, headings, and other parallel elements. Rewrite content so that the structure and punctuation are parallel.

### Use simple punctuation like periods

Reduce punctuation use when possible. Maintain end punctuation when it makes sense—for instance, to distinguish two sentences or fragments.

Try to use periods instead of semicolons, dashes, conjunctions, or anything else that makes sentence structure more complex.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Choose a predefined term",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Choose a pre-defined term.",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "Choose an add-on adventure for your visit. You’ll pick a time in the next step.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Choose an add on adventure for your visit You’ll pick a time in the next step",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "Review more suggestions in Grammarly.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Review more suggestions—in Grammarly; We're your AI writing assistant.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Be correct first, conversational second

Strike a balance between conversational writing and correct grammar. There is rarely a reason to break a grammar rule for the sake of sounding conversational. In most cases, bad writing is distracting, pulls readers out of the experience, and is also off-brand. There's likely a grammatically correct way to say what you need while not bending over backward to adhere to a rule.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Who are you writing to?",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="p">
          To whom are you writing?{" "}
          <Text as="span" italic>
            [This is a little too stuffy!]
          </Text>
        </Text>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "These words will no longer be flagged as misspellings.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "These words will no longer be flagging as misspellings.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>
