# Writing process

The writing process is painfully non-linear.

You might start writing, then find you need research to understand a new problem. Doing that research could mean getting feedback from a peer about if you’re asking the right question or to check the validity of information. After getting feedback, you might be ready to write a draft and quickly move on to editing.

Sometimes writing even looks like staring out of a window—lost in thought.

That is to say, there’s no one correct process for writing. The different stages mentioned here are not meant to be exclusive, nor presented in chronological order.

These are, however, truly the juiciest morsels from Grammarly’s Content Design team to help when you’re stuck at different times while writing.

Establish a vocabulary of terms that they know, use, and understand—this will help you determine the level of complexity you should aim for.</Text>

            <Text as="p">Start anywhere you can and start as soon as possible. It helps to start from a place of curiosity, too. Use the writing process to figure out what you know and what you need to learn more about (see: Research).</Text>
            <Text as="p">Forget what you think you know. Stretch your brain: Think spatially as well as verbally. Stretch your body, too. Then, keep writing. Embrace the idea of a very rough first draft. Sometimes it helps to write on paper (and it’s harder to delete things this way).</Text>
