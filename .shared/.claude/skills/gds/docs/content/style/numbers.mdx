# Numbers

**Numbers** mean the symbols and words that represent measurements, counts, and values. This section is organized alphabetically and applies to content in product UI.

For a full breakdown of Grammarly’s approach to grammar and usage in other external-facing content, visit the <Link href="https://coda.io/d/_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarly-Style-Guide_suVxisx4">Grammarly Company Style Guide</Link>.

## But first, a note about localization

We write for the Grammarly product using American English spelling, grammar, and formatting for text and numbers. Although a user’s writing _is_ corrected by Grammarly based on the dialect of English they choose, the rest of the UI is not localized into either English dialects or other languages. <Link href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n">Learn about localization and internationalization</Link>.

Despite this, it’s important to consider how machine or AI translations by third-party apps and browser extensions could affect our product. For example, certain browser extensions can translate text in UI from English into a different language.

To compensate for this and maximize comprehension:

- Use consistent terminology when applicable
- Write in American English with American formatting
- Apply standards from GDS and the [Company Brand Style Guide](https://coda.io/d/Grammarly-Style-Guide_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarlys-Plans_su4UNXs7)

Keep global political perspectives front of mind when writing for the product. Grammarly’s audience is, in part, people who learn English as a second language. Look for what could be misunderstood and edit it for complete clarity.

## Always use numerals

Always use numerals in the product. Numerals are the symbols that represent numbers—that means 0–9 and 10–10,000, too. Follow American numbering conventions. For example, use a decimal point over a decimal comma. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "2 days ago",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Two days ago",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "10,341",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Ten thousand, three hundred forty-one",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {

      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",

      type: "do",

    {

      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "5,75",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Currency

Above all, be crystal clear about the monetary value you are describing, especially when relaying to a user how much something costs or how much they will spend. Consider, for example, that the *$* symbol can refer to US dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Mexican pesos, and a few other currencies, too. 

### Format

Because it’s crucial that customers know what currency we're referring to, use the currency symbol as well as the internationally recognized, three-letter ISO code. Notably, the ISO currency code for euros is  “EUR,” regardless of country. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "€144.00 EUR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "144,00 € EUR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "€144.00 GER",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "EU€144.00",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "€144.00",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**Do not** assume a currency symbol alone will communicate the country or currency in which a user is making their transaction.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "$10.00 USD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$10.00 AUD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$10.00 CAD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$10.00 MXD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$10.00 NZD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$10.00",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**Do not** write out monetary values as a sentence, mix numerals and written-out values, or vaguely hint at approximate values.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "$4.50 USD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Four dollars and fifty cents US dollars",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$4 and fifty cents USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Approx. $4 USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "~$4 USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**Do not** include a space between the currency symbol and the numeral except when the symbol comes after the value.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "$25.99 USD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$ 25.99 USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "€25.99 EUR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "25,99 € EUR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "€ 25.99 EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Displaying multiple costs at once

When multiple monetary values appear together, such as in a checkout summary, the currency’s explicit form does not need to be repeated when the currency is the same for all values.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/content/currency_do2.svg"),
      caption: "Use the short form for most values, and call attention to the total by using the explicit form.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/content/currency_dont2.svg"),
      caption: "It’s not necessary to repeat the explicit form unless the meaning is unclear in context.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Zero-cost or free items

Write out “$0.00” in numerals, with whole numbers and cents expressed, with one 0 digit before the period. Express cents as well as whole dollars for zero-cost items in order to be precise and polished.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "$0.00",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$0",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$00.00",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Zero dollars",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "0 dollars",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$zero",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "No tax / Tax not applied",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Zero tax",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Nothing!",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Nada!",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Nil!",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Example

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/content/currency_do1.svg"),
      caption: "Follow this guide to keep the format of monetary values consistent and predictable.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/content/currency_dont1.svg"),
      caption: "Don’t mix formats or abbreviate zero without decimals.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Decimals

Always include decimals to the hundredth place. Even if a monetary value is whole (without cents), use “.00” at the end for precision and consistency in formatting. Include decimals for zero values as well.

Do not shorten a decimal to the tenth place for any reason. Likewise, do not give values with fractions of cents.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "$4.50",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$4.5",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$4.508",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "$10.00",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "$10.0",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$10",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Exceptions 

- **For whole values in a heading (h1, h2, h3, etc.):** It’s OK to omit decimals to save space. One example of this is the <Link href="https://www.grammarly.com/plans">plan comparison page</Link>, where prices are listed as h3 headings without decimals because they’re all whole values. If any of the three had cents, then all values should use decimals for consistency.
- **Some currencies do not have cents**, such as the Japanese Yen, while others include cents to the thousandth place, such as the Kuwaiti Dinar.  While Grammarly does not accept payments in these currencies today, be sure to follow the local standards by currency and location to avoid unfamiliar formats.

### Punctuation and symbol placement

#### By location

In general, write for the Grammarly product using American English formatting. However, it’s usually necessary for clarity and comprehension to make sure monetary values are presented in the correct, localized format. 

Grammarly only accepts payments in USD, EUR, GBP, and INR. Customers in any country not listed are charged in US dollars, and the amount is displayed in American English formatting.

Examples display the correct localized format for one-hundred-thousand and eight-hundred-seventy-five dollars and fifty cents.

#### Comma for thousands, period for decimals

In most English-speaking countries, commas mark the thousands place of whole numbers. Periods delineate the whole numbers from fractions of currency (cents). The symbol comes before the value without a space in between.

Use this separator format when displaying currency in the United States, Mexico, United Kingdom, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Malta, and Canada when writing in English.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "£1,000.00 GBP",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "£1000.00 GBP",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "£1 000.00 GBP",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "£1.000,00 GBP",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "£1,000.00 £ GBP",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Period for thousands, comma for decimals

In most European countries and regions influenced by continental European conventions, periods will mark the thousands place of whole currency while commas delineate cents. The currency symbol usually follows the amount and is preceded by a space.

Use this separator format when displaying currency in Europe except where noted previously, as well as Canada if writing in French.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "2.000,00 € EUR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "2000,00 € EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "2 000,00 € EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "2,000.00 € EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "€2.000,00 EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Indian numbering system

The Indian numbering system uses a comma separator after every two digits, except for the last section of whole currency, which is three digits. Decimals are given to the hundredth place.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "₹1,00,800.00 INR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "₹100,800.00 INR",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Negative currency 

#### Minus sign

Use a minus sign to indicate a negative monetary value. Always place the minus sign at the start. **Do not** include a space between the minus sign and the currency symbol or value, depending on the format.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "−$1.00 USD",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "− $1.00 USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$−1.00 USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$1.00 USD−",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "$1.00 −USD",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "−$1",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "−2.00 € EUR",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "− 2.00 € EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "2.00 −€ EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "2.00 € −EUR",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "2.00  EUR−",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "−€2",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**Do not** place a currency value inside of parentheses without a minus sign. Although this format is standard in accounting and finance, it can be unfamiliar to people outside these fields. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "−$5.00",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "(−$5.00)",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "($5.00)",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Be vigilant in how you write or code content—a hyphen or dash is often misused where a minus sign should be. Screen readers more reliably announce the minus sign and will convey the correct meaning for negative currency.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Color

Color can be used in addition to a minus sign, but the use of color alone does not meet accessibility standards. <Link href="https://grammarly.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DP/pages/3898998932/Color">Learn about color and accessibility</Link>.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: <Text as="p" color="deletion-default">−$5.00</Text>,
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: <Text as="p" color="deletion-default">$5.00</Text>,
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: <Text as="p" color="deletion-default">($5.00)</Text>,
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: <Text as="p" color="deletion-default">−$5</Text>,
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

In English-speaking countries, the color <Text as="strong" color="deletion-default">red</Text> is often used to indicate a negative value, while **black** indicates a positive value. However, you should consider how a color’s meaning differs by culture and intended audience. 

For instance, in China, <Text as="strong" color="deletion-default">red</Text> is a symbol of prosperity and indicates growth in monetary values rather than a decline like in the US. You’ll notice this positive association in the emoji for “chart with upward trend” 📈 on most platforms.

## Dates

When following American formatting conventions, place the month first, then the date as a numeral, then the year. Do not use ordinals. Place a comma between the numeral and the year. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "April 1, 2023",
      type: "do",
    },
        {
      content: "April 1st, 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: (
        <Text as="span">April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023</Text>
      ),
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "April first, 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "April 1 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "1 April 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "1 April, 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

When also listing the day of the week, add a comma between the day and month.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Saturday, December 2, 2023",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Saturday December 2, 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

When abbreviating days, which may be necessary to fit space constraints, follow the list below. Use a period after each abbreviation and capitalize only the first letter:

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Mon.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Tue.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Wed.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Thur.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Fri.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Sat.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Sun.",
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>

When only using numerals in American formatting style, format as below: 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "5/31/2024",
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>

For placeholder text in form fields, use uppercase letters.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "[MM/DD/YYYY]",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "[mm/dd/yyyy]",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

When months must be abbreviated, such as when space is constrained, follow the abbreviations below for consistency. Be sure to include a period at the end of the abbreviation. Capitalize only the first letter:

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Jan.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Feb.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "March",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "April",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "May",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "June",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "July",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Aug.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Sept. [not Sep.]",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Oct.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Nov.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Dec.",
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>

When expressing date ranges, use an en dash with one space on either side: 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "December 4, 2023 – December 10, 2023",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "December 4, 2023–December 10, 2023",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "December 4, 2023-December 10, 2023 [that’s a hyphen]",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "December 4, 2023—December 10, 2023 [that’s an em dash]",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Percentages
Always use numerals for percentages—in product and in most external-facing writing. Use a percent sign. Do not add a space between the numeral and the percent sign. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "3.9%",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "3.9 percent",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "3.9 %",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Three point nine percent",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Significant figures

When deciding how to use decimals, ask yourself:
- Is your statistic absolutely exact or is it more like an educated guess? 
- How much precision does the user need to make an informed choice? 

To avoid the impression that a rough estimate is an unimpeachable fact, consider rounding up or down to the nearest whole number for inexact stats and percentages.

If your use case warrants precise metrics, write out statistics and percentages to a maximum of 2 decimal places. Display more precise data only when absolutely necessary to convince or inform.

## Suggestion counts

When displaying the number of suggestions available, use numerals. Follow our general numbering style and include commas every three digits to the left of the decimal point. 

If there are zero suggestions, use “No suggestions.”

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "1 suggestion",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "One suggestion",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "5 suggestions",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Five suggestions",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "1,026 suggestions",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "1026 suggestions",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "No suggestions",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "0 suggestions",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      content: "Zero suggestions",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Times

Use numerals and include the hour and minute digits.

Abbreviate AM and PM in all caps, without periods. Make sure there is a space between the hour/minute digits and the AM and PM abbreviations.

For noon and midnight, spelling it out more clearly (12 noon; 12 midnight) is preferred in places like body text or when there is more space. But if we must follow the # AM/# PM format, style as such: 12 PM (noon) and 12 AM (midnight).

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "4:00 PM",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "11:00 AM",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "12 noon, 12 midnight",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "12 PM, 12 AM",
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>
