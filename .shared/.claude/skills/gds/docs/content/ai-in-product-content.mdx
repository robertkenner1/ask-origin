# Generative AI in product content

Our product increasingly features text created by generative AI, often as elements of the product’s user interface (UI). These standards are unique to effectively implementing this type of generative AI content in the product.

## What is “product content?”

First, let’s define what’s meant by “product content” to set the right context for applying these standards.

Our product uses generative AI content in many different ways, and only some of them qualify as product content. In general, “product content” as the term is used here refers to text in UI elements that users read and interact with. Some traits of product content are:

- It helps a user navigate or understand the product they’re using.
- It is related to the user's needs and questions.
- The way the text fits into the interface requires consideration of structure, formatting, and length restriction.

If you’re working with generative AI content that fits these traits, use these standards. If you’re applying generative AI to change a user’s writing, <Link href="https://grammarly.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CoreProduct/pages/3848470560/Cross-functional+Collaboration">contact the linguist org</Link> for assistance.

### Product content

#### Increase your impact

In this example, introductory text is generated by AI to frame the incoming suggestions. This is product content and a Content Designer had to define its structure, context, and limitations to yield desirable outputs.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-do1.svg")}
    alt="The UI for the experience to increase impact shows an introductory description letting a user know that the changes will help readers understand the multifaceted depiction of joy in A Midsummer Night’s Dream."
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  This text has a distinct structure with limited space, and it frames the user’s interaction with the product.
</p>

#### Inline card for rewrites

This inline card's text must fit into a compact space, and the call to action guides user behavior. While personalized by AI to a specific issue, a Content Designer was necessary to define what the instructional text and interactive call-to-action text should achieve.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-do2.svg")}
    alt="An inline suggestion card reads “Your customers may find your instructions hard to follow” and prompts the user to see simplified steps with a Button."
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  Comprehension is crucial to user activation from this inline suggestion.
</p>

### Not product content

#### Suggestion content

The paragraph-level rewrite in this example fills a flexible container and contains no interaction instructions. This is **not** considered product content because it is only made up of a user’s writing and related corrections managed by the linguist org.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-dont1.svg")}
    alt="The UI for full-paragraph rewrites shows a suggestion with chunks of highlighted changes to a user’s writing."
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  Though surrounding Buttons and headings are indeed considered product content, Content Designers aren’t responsible for managing corrections or rules in back-end systems.
</p>

#### AI output

This generated text from a preset prompt may have structure, but it’s the output from a user interaction and doesn’t relate to Grammarly’s product UI.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-dont2.svg")}
    alt="A user’s claim about the theme of joy in A Midsummer Night’s Dream is called into question and it’s suggested to add a citation to strengthen the information."
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  Neither the writer’s claim nor the corresponding recommendation come from the Content Design org—this is all powered by generative AI.
</p>

## Usage

Choosing when to use generative AI is as important as how you use it. It allows us to create dynamic, unique content that no other technology can. But it can also be slow, expensive, and unpredictable. 

### When to use generative AI

Grammarly is an AI writing partner, and generative AI content can make that persona feel more intelligent and personal. Use generative AI content when:

- A personalized element can make the product feel warmer and more aware
- Adding unique details makes an action more straightforward or urgent
- A bespoke analysis would provide better assistance

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-do3.svg"),
      caption: "AI is used to detect context and deliver an empowering message with personalized details in the heading.",
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>

### When not to use it

Grammarly is also a software product with technical requirements and limitations. Avoid generative AI content when:

- Specific information is available in simpler ways. It may be easier and more reliable to reference a database than to use generative AI.
- Product speed is essential. Generative AI is getting faster, but it still introduces delays into the product.
- Gains are marginal. While generative AI content can be used almost anywhere, its cost and complexity mean it should be reserved for high-impact implementations.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-dont3.svg"),
      caption: "AI models can struggle to reproduce exact details, like this list of prompts. This is static content written by a Content Designer even though it appears where generative AI output is typically shown.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Unique considerations

### Follow Content Design principles

To our users, AI-generated text is no different than any other kind. So, if it appears in the interfaces of our products, we hold it to the same standards as all product content. To see how we ensure high-quality content at Grammarly, start with our [best practices](/content/best-practices) and [voice and tone guidelines](/content/voice-and-tone). 

If you have questions or need Content Design assistance, reach out in <Link href="https://grammarly.slack.com/archives/C02LBAV6JDP">#ama-content-design on Slack</Link>.

### Pronouns

In general, content should follow our standard guidance to use third-person pronouns when speaking as the product or company.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "We can improve your email to your boss",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "I can improve your email to your boss",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

However, we also allow users to chat with the AI and the models we use default to first-person pronouns for their responses. Changing this is difficult and unreliable, and the results can sound awkward. 

In these cases, the product should use first-person pronouns.

<Text as="p" marginLeft={8}>**User prompt:** “Do you like my essay?”</Text>

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "I’m an AI, so I don’t have likes or dislikes. However …",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "We’re an AI, so we don’t have likes or dislikes. However …",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Content in the product should clarify that the chat persona is a specific agent within the larger Grammarly product. Use phrases like “Chat with our AI” to mitigate this inconsistency.

### Tense

If we use generative AI content to describe an action the user can take, the model may default to past tense because it has already generated a potential response. The user, however, still needs to take action, so the text should be in the present tense.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Simplify your text",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Simplified your text",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Text length

While AI models can follow general guidance about text length, they cannot reliably follow a strict character count. You should allow some flexibility when designing UI elements that include generative AI content.

### Default text

Generative AI models sometimes fail or generate unusable text. To mitigate these issues, create default text with a generic version of what the model would generate that can be used when the issues occur.

This example of default text is a fallback option to mitigate unpredictable possibilities, like truncating text or displaying AI errors, of AI-generated introductory text.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-default-text.svg")}
    alt="Heading and body copy that are usually generated by AI have a fallback, static option that reads “Let’s make your text more effective. These changes can help you craft a more compelling message for your audience.”"
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  Whenever a heading becomes too long, a human-written default appears instead. Likewise, before displaying body text to a user, there is an automatic check for AI errors. The default body copy shown here can be displayed when necessary to work around unpredictable AI outputs.
</p>

### Blended content

Generative AI content and static content can sit side-by-side to create dynamic text that retains some predictable phrasing. You can do this with a clear separation between the two:

- **Static:** “You sound:”
- **AI generated:** “Confident, excited”

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-do4.svg")}
    alt="3 different checks for a user’s content appear in an inline card. The first says “You sound: Confident, excited.” Then, “Reading flow: Fast to read, scannable.” Then, “Open questions: None—nice work!”"
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  A thoughtful combination of handwritten and AI-generated content can yield effective and efficient results for users.
</p>

Or you can blend them seamlessly:

- **Static:** “These changes can”
- **AI generated:** “help make …”

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-do5.svg")}
    alt="The introductory text for a set of loading suggestions reads “These changes can help make the co-working meeting more engaging and productive for your team members.”"
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  A consistent opening, “These changes can,” helps orient users with clear expectations of what they're about to receive.
</p>

## How to work with generative AI in product content

If we want generative AI content to meet these standards, we need ways to guide the models in doing so. Apply this process and work with technical partners in linguistics and engineering to generate high-quality product content.

### Define rules

Write a list of rules the generative AI content should follow. These should include all relevant elements of the content, such as formatting, phrasing, and length.

Review and revise these rules with your technical partners. While some rules can be included in the generative AI prompt, others may be implemented in pre- or post-processing steps that modify the content. Discuss what’s possible and find a solution that meets your needs.

### Write samples

Often, the best way to get generative AI to produce reliable output is to provide samples of what you want. Content Designers should write several samples that cover the range of desired variations in output. More diverse samples will result in more varied output. Four or five samples is often enough, but more can be added if needed.

Samples can be written from scratch, but if the model already exists, you can use its outputs as a starting point. Revise a diverse range of outputs into versions that follow your rules. You can also write new samples to expand the range of outputs. 

### Review and adjust output

When the model is ready to generate content, review a broad range of its outputs. Document where and how they don’t meet the guidelines. Discuss the issues with your technical partners and figure out how to address them. You may have to adjust your rules, provide new or revised samples, make changes to processing, or decide to accept the imperfections.

Then, repeat this step as needed until the results are ready to ship.

## Case study: Headings in sideline cards

Here’s a real-world example of how a Content Designer used this process generate the headings of a new feature.

<div className="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/AI-content-do6.svg")}
    alt="A full-paragraph rewrite has a heading that says “Sound more engaging.”"
  />
</div>
<p className="caption">
  The heading of this sideline card, “Sound more engaging,” is an example of dynamic text generated by AI that changes every time a user interacts with the feature.
</p>

### Define rules

For sidelines cards, each suggested revision features a heading generated by AI. The Content Designer created rules for the text to follow to ensure it is consistent, clear, and actionable.

> The heading exists to give users a brief, clear summary of the suggested change so they can understand it quickly and decide if they want to accept it. To meet that goal, let’s set these initial guidelines:
> <br></br>
> - Headings should be framed as actions a user can take rather than descriptions of changes made by the product.
>   - Use the present tense.
>   - Use simple, everyday vocabulary.
> - To make headings feel personal, we can occasionally use second-person language to refer to the user’s text, such as “your text” or “your writing.”
> - Be as specific as possible when describing the change.

### Write samples

In this case, a simple model already exists, so the Content Designer referenced those outputs to write sample headings.

> The existing model’s outputs are too similar, and we need to improve the variety of responses. Use these revised samples to enhance future outputs:
> <br></br>
> <table>
>  <caption className="table-caption">Punctuation and symbols in currency by location</caption>
>  <thead>
>      <tr>
>        <th width="10%">Source</th>
>        <th>Original</th>
>        <th>Revised</th>
>      </tr>
>  </thead>
>  <tbody>
>    <tr>
>      <td>1</td>
>      <td>Increased warmth</td>
>      <td>Use a casual tone</td>
>    </tr>
>    <tr>
>      <td>2</td>
>      <td>Increased warmth and friendliness</td>
>      <td>Sound more empathetic</td>
>    </tr>
>    <tr>
>      <td>3</td>
>      <td>Increased warmth and encouragement</td>
>      <td>Sound more encouraging</td>
>    </tr>
>    <tr>
>      <td>4</td>
>      <td>Increased warmth</td>
>      <td>Add cheerful language</td>
>    </tr>
>    <tr>
>      <td>5</td>
>      <td>Increased warmth</td>
>      <td>Highlight the sense of camaraderie</td>
>    </tr>
>  </tbody>
> </table>

### Review and adjust output

The team implements the changes, and the project’s Content Designer tests how the headings appear for many different kinds of texts. They notice that the model tends to generate headings with redundant descriptions. The Content Designer drafts a new rule for the text to follow and writes illustrative samples.

> For brevity, headings should only describe a single change. The model likes to add extra changes even if we don’t ask for them, so we should work to mitigate that.
> <br></br>
> <table>
>  <caption className="table-caption">Punctuation and symbols in currency by location</caption>
>  <thead>
>      <tr>
>        <th width="50%">Original</th>
>        <th width="50%">Revised</th>
>      </tr>
>  </thead>
>  <tbody>
>    <tr>
>      <td>Sound more personal and engaging</td>
>      <td>Sound more personal</td>
>    </tr>
>    <tr>
>      <td>Make it engaging and inclusive</td>
>      <td>Make it more inclusive</td>
>    </tr>
>  </tbody>
> </table>

### Test and ship 

The Content Designer tests the revised headings again. The issue occurs less frequently but isn’t fixed completely. The team knows this is a common quirk of generative AI content and has decided that the quality still meets our standards. 

The product, including its AI-generated content, is ready to be shipped to customers. 🚀
