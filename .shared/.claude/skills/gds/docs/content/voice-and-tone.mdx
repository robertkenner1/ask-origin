# Voice and tone

Grammarly’s brand voice is bold, empowering, and warm. Our voice should always contain these three attributes. Bold, empowering, and warm don’t need to be perfectly balanced. But they should always be present.

For in-product content, there are ways we can harness these attributes in a way that aligns with content design best practices.

## Bold

We communicate crisply, directly, and decisively. We showcase our expertise. We are confident we provide the solutions people need.

**Decisive and direct**  
Not wishy-washy—but not commanding or patronizing

**Confident that we are the experts**  
Not overly humble or unassertive—but not flashy or aggressive

**Crisp and succinct**  
Not rambling or flowery—but not stiff or harsh

## Empowering

We are positive, clear, and helpful. We encourage and inspire confident communication. We lead people toward powerful results.

**Positive, encouraging, and inspiring**  
Not negative or demotivating—but not overpromising

**Helpful and supportive**  
Not unconcerned—but not coddling or hand-holding

**Clear and ready to walk you through it**  
Not vague—but not piling on unnecessary details

## Warm

We resonate as trustworthy, approachable, and human. Our conversational approach signals empathy.

**Human and empathetic**  
Not robotic or vacantly corporate—but not sentimental

**Trustworthy**  
Not cryptic—but not overly reassuring or desperate

**Approachable and conversational**  
Not cold—but not excessively friendly or informal

      <Text as="p">This copy is too warm. It’s also a touch too bold. And it’s not empowering.</Text>
      <Text as="p">The word choice (friend! oodles!) is too cutesy, especially for an enterprise audience. It sounds a bit like we’re talking to a small child or a dog (which is not very professional). Also, two exclamation points in a row? That’s too friendly and too bold.</Text>
      <Text as="p">This promises to help, but it’s not clear about what’s happening to be truly empowering. We want to walk people through it efficiently. An onboarding flow should be crystal clear, easy-breezy, and direct: welcoming and to the point.</Text>

        <Text as="p">There’s some welcoming warmth, but we’re not encumbered with pizzazz.</Text>
        <Text as="p">It’s professionally conversational and approachable. Using “your” creates a connection. We foreground what the metrics actually mean to the person reading this. Our word choice is positive: “Areas for improvement” is more optimistic than, for instance, “weaknesses.”</Text>
        <Text as="p">We convey information clearly and crisply. Our language aligns with our audience of a new enterprise user. We need to walk users through this flow swiftly and as enjoyably as possible, and this does the job.</Text>

      <Text as="p">This is a great example of our old voice and tone when it came to suggestion cards in our product. It’s very helpful and shows we are experts.</Text>
      <Text as="p">When viewed through the lens of our new brand voice, it could feel more confident, especially as grammatical error correction is our expertise—the language feels a bit too soft and hedging. We can also consider the perspective of someone who doesn’t know anything about grammar—and may feel intimidated by grammatical terms—and lead with plainer language.</Text>

        <Text as="p">To be more empowering, we led with “you’re trying to show possession” instead of the less-approachable “genitive case.” We still aim to empower, however, by explaining the term and showing examples.</Text>

      <Text as="p">We’ve got three strong instances of wordplay—and two puns that really take a second to grasp. (And they also look too much like spelling mistakes.) Yes, it’s conversational, but it’s too cheesy and too bold, to a point where it’s just distracting. In the past, our copy has embraced cornier puns like this (as delighting as they are), but moving forward, we should aim for more sophisticated wordplay.</Text> 
      <Text as="p">Perhaps most importantly: It’s not clear what we’re telling our audience, the user of our product. We need to communicate that there are no more suggestions from Grammarly, but that’s totally lost amid the puns.</Text>

        <Text as="p">This is much simpler and is within the right ranges of bold, empowering, and warm for this kind of in-product copy. It’s short, to the point, and sounds like a person wrote it.</Text>
        <Text as="p">The priority here is that we tell the user there are no more suggestions from Grammarly, so we don’t necessarily need razzle-dazzle.</Text>

      <Text as="p">This copy is simultaneously not empowering and too warm and bold. Robot language for a tech company is very last century, so it’s more cringe and corny than fresh and lively. It also feels panicky—robots are down conveys that Grammarly itself is broken, not just the page.</Text> 
      <Text as="p">It’s not clear what someone is supposed to do next, making it the opposite of empowering. Its curt, robotic heading (“404”) is too cold. As a whole, it’s not in Grammarly’s brand voice—and it’s not very funny (sorry, robots).</Text>

        <Text as="p">It’s clearer and more helpful: A few links are considerate, yet we provide only as much information as a reader needs. We’re able to bring in a touch of wordplay because most people know what a 404 page is—it likely doesn’t need explaining or further context.</Text>
