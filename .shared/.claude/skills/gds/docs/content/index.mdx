# Content

Use these resources when writing within the Grammarly product. Our in-product guidelines are a constrained version of Grammarly's overall <Link href="https://coda.io/d/_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarly-Style-Guide_suVxisx4">Company Style Guide</Link>—reflecting the needs of designing highly usable experiences.

<div className="diagram-no-border p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/content/style-guides-diagram.svg")}
    alt="A diagram showing how the in-product Content style guide is a subset of the Company style guide"
  />
</div>
<br />

Our goal is for you to feel confident about maintaining a consistent brand voice and style within our product. You’re in the right place if you’re wondering things like:

- **[Style](/content/style):** Do we use numerals (1,2,3) or spell out numbers (one, two, three) in UI?
- **[Terminology](/content/terminology):** Does a “suggestion” or “correction” fix a “mistake” or an “issue?”
- **[Naming](/content/terminology/#product-and-feature-names):** What do we call Grammarly’s entry point on Mac and Windows?
- **[Voice and tone](/content/voice-and-tone):** How do we speak to users, and who is Grammarly’s audience?

If you have a question about a piece of guidance or want to know something that isn’t included, reach out in <Link href="https://grammarly.slack.com/archives/C02LBAV6JDP">#ama-content-design</Link>.

If you’re writing content outside of the product—marketing copy in ads and emails, landing pages, blogs, social media posts, or support documentation—visit the <Link href="https://coda.io/d/_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarly-Style-Guide_suVxisx4">Grammarly Company Style Guide</Link> on Confluence.
