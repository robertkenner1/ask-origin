# Transforms

A Transform is the text that Grammarly recommends adding or deleting.

<Hero
  path={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_hero.svg")}
  altText="A card displays transforms that indicate the suggested changes to the user's text."
/>
<p class="caption">
  The transforms highlighted in the suggestion card tell the user what will change when the
  suggestion is accepted.
</p>

## Anatomy

<div class="diagram">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_anatomy.svg")}
    alt="Anatomy diagram of transforms in a suggestion card"
  />
</div>
<ol class="diagram-legend small">
  <li>Deletion transform</li>
  <li>Addition transform</li>
</ol>

## Deletions

Deletions are the text that Grammarly is suggesting that the user remove.

<img style={{width: '100%'}}
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_deletions.svg")}
  alt="Deletion transforms have a strikethrough and a gray background color."
/>

### Deletion Styles

Deletion text is `Text S` regular with a strikethrough using the `text-deletion` color token. The text color is `#696969` to meet contrast requirements against the highlight. Borders are added around punctuation to improve visibility.


<img style={{width: '100%'}}
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_deletions_styles.svg")}
  alt="Deletion text is gray with a strikethrough."
/>

<br/>
<br/>
Deletion highlights are rendered as a background color on the text. The highlight is `#9C9C9C` at 20% opacity for both light and dark modes.

<img style={{width: '100%'}}
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_deletions_highlights.svg")}
  alt="Deletion highlights are a transparent gray background around the text."
/>


## Additions

Additions are the text that Grammarly is suggesting that the user add.

<img style={{width: '100%'}}
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_additions.svg")}
  alt="Addition transforms have bolded text and a green background color."
/>

### Addition Styles

Addition text is `Text S` semibold using the `text-addition` color token. Borders are added around punctuation to improve visibility.

<img style={{width: '100%'}}
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_additions_styles.svg")}
  alt="Addition text is green and bolded."
/>

<br/>
<br/>
Addition highlights are rendered as a background-color on the text. The highlight is `#27DCCD` at 20% opacity for both light and dark modes.

<img style={{width: '100%'}}
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_additions_highlights.svg")}
  alt="Addition highlights are a transparent gray background around the text."
/>

## Examples

Transforms should be the same across all Grammarly platforms. These are notional examples and not all platforms may reflect these designs yet.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_examples.svg")}
  alt="Transform treatment is the same across all Grammarly platforms."
/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_editor_examples.svg")}
  alt="Transform treatment is shown in the Editor app."
/>

### Inline Card Exceptions

Inline cards use buttons to apply text suggestions and therefore require a different stylistic treatment. Text colors remain consistent with other suggestions but don't include a highlight color. Addition and deletion text both use a semibold font weight.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/transforms_inline_examples.svg")}
  alt="Transform treatment is slightly different in inline surfaces."
/>
