# Pro plan branding

Defines how Pro plan branded UI elements are displayed in the product.

<Hero
  path={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_hero.svg")}
  altText="A Pro suggestion in V-bars is highlighted with a Pro plan upsell card"
/>
<p class="caption">

## Brand Elements

### Star Icon

A `gold-40` or `neutral-gray-100` filled star icon is used to represent Pro plans. For further guidance see the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star-icon.svg")} 
    alt="Pro branded stars are gold and dark gray" 
  />
</div>

<br />

### Pro Tag

The Pro Tag signals or classifies content related to Grammarly’s Pro plan. For further guidance on usage, 
[visit the Brand Vault](https://brand.grammarly.com/d/uR4A97A21vRU/brand-guidelines#/visual-language/plan-tags).

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_plan-tag.svg")} 
    alt="There are two Pro branded tags. One verion is gold with a dark gray star and the other is dark grey with a gold star. 
    There is a mockup showing the My Grammarly page with a Pro plan tag to indicate the user has a Pro account." 
  />
</div>

<br />

### Stickers

The Sticker displays a temporary or time-sensitive discount on Grammarly’s Pro plan. For further guidance on usage, 
[visit the Brand Vault](https://brand.grammarly.com/d/uR4A97A21vRU/brand-guidelines#/visual-language/plan-tags).

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_sticker.png")} 
    alt="Pro stickers show a 50% off Grammarly Pro discount. There is an email mockup with the Pro sticker on top of a hero image. 
    The hero image shows a young professional typing on a laptop." 
  />
</div>

## Best Practices

### Star Icon

#### Never overuse star icon
Do not overuse the star icon in small spaces, such as UI cards. In the example, the suggestion card with one star draws attention 
to the banner, while the suggestion card with two stars competes for attention.

<Recommendations
      recommendations={[
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_do-1.svg"),
          caption: "Do use the star icon to create hiererarchy and draw attention to the Pro content.",
          type: "do",
        },
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-1.svg"),
          caption: "Do not use multiple star icons in small spaces where they start to compete.",
          type: "dont",
        },
      ]}
    />

<br />

#### Always pair star icon with name
The star icon should always be paired with the Pro or Grammarly Pro plan name. The example without the plan name has no context for what the icon means and may lead to confusion. 

<Recommendations
      recommendations={[
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_do-2.svg"),
          caption: "Do pair the star icon with the Pro and Grammarly Pro plan names.",
          type: "do",
        },
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-2.svg"),
          caption: "Do not use the star icon without the plan names Pro or Grammarly Pro.",
          type: "dont",
        },
      ]}
    />

<br />

#### Always use correct color
Always use `gold-40` or `neutral-gray-100` when using this icon for Pro plan content. Using any other colors is considered off-brand. 

<Recommendations
      recommendations={[
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_do-3.svg"),
          caption: "Do use GDS tokens as a fill color for the Pro plan star icon.",
          type: "do",
        },
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-3.svg"),
          caption: "Do not use other colors as the fill color for the Pro plan star icon.",
          type: "dont",
        },
      ]}
    />

<br />

### Button Color

Use the `background-pro-default` color for CTA buttons related to Pro.

<Recommendations
      recommendations={[
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_do-4.svg"),
          caption: "Do use the `background-pro-default` color for CTA buttons related to Pro plans.",
          type: "do",
        },
        {
          image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-4.svg"),
          caption: "Do not use colors from outside of the Pro color palette for CTA buttons related to Pro plans.",
          type: "dont",
        },
      ]}
    />

<br />
<br />

## UI Elements

### Color

The accent color, `gold-40`, is used solely for Pro branding in the product. It is important not to use this color for other elements, as it helps users quickly identify and understand the elements related to Pro plans.

The text color, `neutral-gray-100`, is used for copy and the star icon when placed on `gold-40` backgrounds.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_plan_UI_elements-color.svg")} 
    alt="Gold is shown as the accent color, dark gray as the text color, and tints and shades of gold are used for highlights, underlines, and vbars." 
  />
</div>

<br />

### Underlines

Pro underlines and highlights appear over the user’s text when there are Pro suggestions. The same colors are used in both light and dark modes. 

The Pro underline consists of two 1px borders using `gold-40` and `gold-60`. The `gold-60` underline ensures a 3:1 contrast while maintaining vibrancy and 
the perception of a single underline. The highlight color is `gold-40` at 25% opacity.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_plan_UI_elements-underlines.svg")} 
    alt="Pro underlines and highlights are shown on light mode and dark mode themes." 
  />
</div>

<br />

### V-bars

Pro V-bars have the same two-color treatment as underlines. The fill of the V-bar is `gold-40`, and the outer border is `gold-60`.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_plan_UI_elements-vbars.svg")} 
    alt="A block of text is shown with a Pro V-bar." 
  />
</div>

<br />
<br />

## Examples
### Pro Plan Upgrade Hook

This Pro plan upgrade hook (also known as locked UI) uses Pro colors for the highlight, underline, and CTA button. The gold star icon represents Pro as a visual element. 
For more details on how to incorporate Pro branding into your design, see the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_plan-upgradehook.svg")} 
    alt="A UI card is shown with the Grammarly suggestion blurred out. A gold CTA button is on the card with text that says Get Pro." 
  />
</div>

<br />

### Plans Page and Checkout Flow

In the Pro plan checkout flow, the CTA buttons use Pro colors for default and hover states from the Plans landing page through the payment details page.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img 
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/pro_plan_checkout.png")} 
    alt="An animation showing a click through of the checkout flow. The animation starts on the Pro landing page and clicks through the plan selection page and payments page. The Pro branding is present throughout." 
  />
</div>
