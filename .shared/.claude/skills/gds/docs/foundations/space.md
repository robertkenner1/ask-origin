# Space
<span>Space is an essential tool that helps organize content into intuitive, visually consistent experiences. When applied correctly, space improves usability and creates a sense of cohesiveness and familiarity.</span>

## Tokens
The Grammarly Design System uses a base-4 model for spatial values. The number in each token name is the multiplier or divisor based on 4px as the default value. (e.g., gds-space-3 * 4 = 12px)

These values are used within components for padding and spacing and should also be applied within product design layouts.
