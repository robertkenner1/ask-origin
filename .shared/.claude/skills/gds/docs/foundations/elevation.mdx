# Elevation

  Shadows add depth and give the appearance of elevation between surfaces in the UI. Elevation helps
  establish a visual hierarchy between overlapping elements and, in some cases, indicates that an
  element is interactive. 

## Styles

Three elevation heights are available—low, medium, and high.

<Flex direction="row" gap={6}>
  <div className="elevation e-low">Low</div>
  <div className="elevation e-medium">Medium</div>
  <div className="elevation e-high">High</div>
</Flex>


### Accessibility

The boundary of overlay elements needs to achieve 3:1 contrast compared to the background. Our elevation styles use multiple drop shadows to meet the required contrast.

### Using elevation

**In Figma:** 
- Turn on the **GDS Foundations** library
- Select the frame or group you want to be elevated
- Hover on **Effects** near the bottom of the the Design panel
- Click the **Styles** Icon Button
- Choose from low, medium, or high elevation

**In code:** Elevation is available as tokens. [View the elevation tokens](/tokens/elevation).
