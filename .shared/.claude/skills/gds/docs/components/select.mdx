# Select

<span>A Select allows a user to choose a single item from a list of options.</span>

<ComponentStatusRow name="Select" />
<Hero
  path={useBaseUrl("/img/components/select_hero.svg")}
  altText="A select is used in the customization settings, allowing a user to select American English as their preferred dialect for writing from a dropdown list of options."
/>
<div className="caption">
  The customization settings use a Select to allow a user to indicate the dialect of English they
  usually write in.
</div>

## Usage

Although Select and Combobox offer similar functionality, Select is preferable because of its simplicity and cross-platform benefits.

**Use when:**

- There are at least two predefined options.
- The options cannot be easily presented all at once.
- Only one option can be selected at a time.
- The options are simple words or phrases without extra content or decoration.

**Do not use when:**

- The options can be easily presented all at once. Instead, use a [Radio Group](/components/radio-group).
- A user can select multiple options from the list. Instead, use a [Checkbox Group](/components/checkbox/#checkbox-group).
- Options in the list contain content beyond a simple name, such as helper text or icons. Instead, use a [Combobox](/components/combobox).
- Options in the list perform actions that take immediate effect. Instead, use a [Button](/components/button) or a [Menu](/components/menu).
- Options in the list navigate to another page or among sections within a page. Instead, use a [Link](/components/link) or a [Menu](/components/menu).

  <li>Input field</li>
  <li>Selected option</li>
  <li>List of options</li>
  <li>Expand Icon Button</li>
</ol>

## Examples

### Default

By default, a Select includes the input field, a `label`, and at least two selectable items.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Select label="Sort by">
      <Select.Option value="name" label="Name" />
      <Select.Option value="count" label="Count" />
      <Select.Option value="recent" label="Most recent" />
    </Select>
  `}
/>

### With helper text

Use the `helperMessage` prop to display additional details beyond the label.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Select label="Company size" helperMessage="Estimate how many people you work with.">
      <Select.Option value="me" label="Just me" />
      <Select.Option value="20" label="2-20" />
      <Select.Option value="50" label="21-50" />
      <Select.Option value="100" label="51-100" />
      <Select.Option value="250" label="101-250" />
    </Select>
  `}
/>

### With an error

Use the `errorMessage` prop to change the color of the field’s outline to red and display an error message.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");
  return (
    <Flex width={250}>
    <Select
      label="Date range"
      value={value}
      onChange={setValue}
      errorMessage={Boolean(value) ? null : "Select a date range to view results."}
    >
      <Select.Option value="" label="Select an option" />
      <Select.Option value="week" label="Last 7 days" />
      <Select.Option value="month" label="Last 30 days" />
      <Select.Option value="custom" label="Custom range" />
    </Select>
    </Flex>
  );
}
`}
/>

### Hidden label

Set `labelDisplay="hidden"` to display a Select without a visible label. A label is still required for people using a screen reader. [Learn about accessibility for hidden labels](/components/switch#hidden-labels).

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Select label="Date range" labelDisplay="hidden">
      <Select.Option value="week" label="Last 7 days" />
      <Select.Option value="month" label="Last 30 days" />
      <Select.Option value="custom" label="Custom range" />
    </Select>
  `}
/>

### Required or optional indicator

Use the `isRequired` or `isOptional` props to add an indicator to the label. Follow the Form pattern to decide when to indicate a field is required or optional. [Learn about required and optional indicators](/patterns/forms#required-or-optional-indicator).

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Select label="Date range" isRequired>
      <Select.Option value="week" label="Last 7 days" />
      <Select.Option value="month" label="Last 30 days" />
      <Select.Option value="custom" label="Custom range" />
    </Select>
  `}
/>

### Disabled

Use the `isDisabled` prop on an entire Select component to indicate that a user cannot focus, change, or interact with the Select.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Select label="Date range" isDisabled>
      <Select.Option value="week" label="Last 7 days" />
      <Select.Option value="month" label="Last 30 days" />
      <Select.Option value="custom" label="Custom range" />
    </Select>
  `}
/>

### Disabled options

Use the `disabled` prop on an individual list option to prevent a user from focusing, interacting with, or choosing it.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Select label="Date range">
      <Select.Option value="week" label="Last 7 days" />
      <Select.Option value="month" label="Last 30 days" />
      <Select.Option value="custom" label="Custom range" disabled />
    </Select>
  `}
/>

## Behavior

### Opening and closing the option list

A user can click or tap a Select's input field to open the list of options.

The list is closed when a user does any of the following actions:

- Chooses an option in the list
- Clicks or taps anywhere outside of the list
- Presses the Esc key

## Accessibility

An independent affordance should be available for a user to consciously save the Select’s current value in the system. For actions that take immediate effect or for navigation to another page, use a [Button](/components/button), a [Link](/components/link), or a [Menu](/components/menu) instead.

This is recommended for two reasons:

- **It prevents accidental saving:** A Select is typically used to allow a user to choose from a predefined set of options. If a user accidentally selects an option from the list, it could lead to data unintentionally being saved. This can be frustrating for a user, especially if there is no confirmation step.
- **A Select lacks confirmation:** Since selecting an option from a dropdown menu is quick, it’s not ideal for actions with significant consequences, like saving data.

A typical example of the recommended interaction is a **Save** Button at the end of a Form with multiple Selects or other inputs. The Form data is stored only after the user activates **Save**.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/select_do.svg"),
      caption: "Always provide a way to save selections that is independent from the Select.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/select_dont.svg"),
      caption: "Do not use a Select for actions that take immediate effect.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Hidden labels

A Select’s label can only be plain text without any rich formatting. Because of this, it may sometimes be necessary to hide the label visually. For example, if you need to use custom styling like adding a Tag.

In this case, a `label` is still required, but `labelDisplay="hidden"` can be used to visually hide the label while maintaining accessibility for people using screen readers. Use `aria-labelledby` to associate the visible text with the control so that the text serves as the label.

### Keyboard navigation

## Writing

### Labels

Labels help a user scan the various inputs in a Form. A label should describe the purpose of an individual input while clearly distinguishing each input from one another.

### List of options

A user can scan the list item by item to select an option.

They can also type letters or numbers as they would for a search. For example, in a list of countries, typing “c” could jump to “Canada” initially, but typing “c” then “o” would go to “Colombia.”

To make sure that lists are predictable and options are relevant, it’s important to:

- Alphabetize list items (a, b, c) and list numbers in ascending order (1, 2, 3)
- Prioritize brevity and consistency over brand voice for each item’s name

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/select_list_items_do.svg"),

      caption:
        "Do not vary structure or verb tense within list items, as this introduces uncertainty in ordering and searching.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Helper text

Helper text takes different forms to fit specific needs. Some helper text tells a user what to do using action verbs, while other helper text defines terms and requirements with punchy fragments of information. [View examples of helper text](/patterns/forms-pattern/forms/#helper-text).

        "Include punctuation if it’s a complete sentence or to distinguish two fragments.",
      recommendationDont: "Do not use exclamation points.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Unselected option

You can choose to present a Select component without a default selection. For the unselected option, it is recommended to use one of the following labels:

- **In compact spaces:** “Select”
- **When space allows:** “Select an option”
- **In any surface:** A blank option without text

Use the same unselect option consistently within a Form or workflow. Otherwise said, don’t switch the labels of the unselected options in Select components that appear near each other.

To convey information necessary for a user to understand their selection’s impact, use the Select component’s label or helper text that is accessible to a screen reader.

  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/select_placeholder_do.svg"),

### Error messages

<ErrorRecs />

## Installation

1. Import the CSS (if not done already).

```css
@import "@grammarly/design-system";
```

2. Import the Select component in JS.

```tsx
import { Select } from "@grammarly/design-system";
