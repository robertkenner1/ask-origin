# Rating

<span>
  The Rating component allows users to express quick, lightweight feedback by selecting a rating

## Usage

The Rating component is designed to be used inside a native `<form>` element. It supports form validation flows by exposing its state through controlled props like `value` and `isError`.

**Use when:**

- Use when collecting quick, lightweight feedback from users.

**Do not use when:**

- Users are in the middle of performing a task.
- Feedback is needed in in multiple places on the page or across several steps.
- Detailed insights or research are required.

## States

### Default

By default, the star rating is unselected.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(undefined);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

### 1-star

1 star is selected with the corresponding label “Not valuable.”

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(0);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

### 2-star

2 stars are selected with the corresponding label “Slightly valuable.”

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(1);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

### 3-star

3 stars are selected with the corresponding label “Moderately valuable.”

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(2);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

### 4-star

4 stars are selected with the corresponding label “Fairly valuable.”

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(3);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

### 5-star

5 stars are selected with the corresponding label “Very valuable.”

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(4);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

### Hover state

The star is filled when a user hovers over the star icons. The star rating label appears when a user hovers over the corresponding star for each level. Once selected, the state of each star and its label are preserved.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/rating/rating_hover.svg")}
    alt="A mouse hovering on 2-star rating with star rating label 'slightly valuable'."
  />
</div>

### Focus state

The star is outlined when a user's focus is over the star icon.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/rating/rating_focus.svg")} alt="A focus on first star" />
</div>

### Error state

The component renders a red outline around the container and displays an error message below the stars.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    function Example() {
    const label = "How valuable was this suggestion?";
    const [rating, setRating] = React.useState(undefined);
    const [error, setError] = React.useState(true);

    return (
        <Rating label={label} isError={error} value={rating} onChange={setRating} />
      )
    }

`}
/>

## Behavior

### Layout and Responsiveness

The width of the component is determined by the width of its container. When the available space is narrower than the combined width of the stars and their labels, the layout adjusts to maintain usability:

- Labels may wrap beneath the stars if they can’t fit inline.
- If the longest label exceeds the container width, all labels will reflow beneath their corresponding stars to ensure consistent alignment.

### States

The component has several interactive visual states:

- **Default**: All five stars are outlined and unselected.
- **Hover**: Stars up to the hovered index become filled. A label associated with the hovered star is displayed.
- **Selected**: After selecting a rating, stars up to the selected value are filled permanently, and the corresponding label is shown.
- **Hover after selection**: Hovering again temporarily overrides the visual display of the selected rating. When the user moves the pointer away, the selected state returns.

### Error Handling

Use the `isError` prop to display an error message and highlight the component visually, typically when a user submits a form without selecting a rating.

- The error state is controlled externally and does not reset automatically.
- To clear the error, update the `isError` prop in the parent component (e.g., after a user selects a valid rating).
- This makes the Rating component suitable for use in required form flows or feedback validation logic.

## Accessibility

## Writing

To ensure clarity, consistency, and a positive user experience, follow these writing best practices when designing the Rating component.
