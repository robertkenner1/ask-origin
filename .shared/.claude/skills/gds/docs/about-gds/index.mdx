# About the Grammarly Design System

The Grammarly Design System (GDS) is an internal product built by the Design Foundations team that empowers the organization to produce high-quality software at scale. Our primary audiences are designers and engineers, but anyone building Grammarly product offerings can benefit from it. The design system is designed, built, and maintained by Grammarly's Design System team in collaboration with the design and engineering communities.

## Our principles

#### Tools over rules

A successful system is a mix of stability and flexibility. It's a toolbox that encourages creativity and exploration, not a rigid set of unchanging rules. We support our partners by providing the right tools for the job.

#### Everyone has a seat at the table

The people building products are our partners, not just consumers. If we don't consider their needs, how will we know if we're building the right things? We invite partners from across disciplines into the process so that the system reflects their diverse perspectives and areas of expertise. Working together collaboratively will lead to trust, and trust will lead to adoption.

#### Be completely inclusive​

Effective communication should be accessible to everyone, inclusive of any range of abilities. Accessibility is a mindset we work to cultivate across teams, integrating it into product plans, colors, components, patterns, and code. We'll meet users' needs by taking the time to prioritize function and quality.

#### Design with scale in mind

We create reusable components and elements that reduce technical and design debt. If something is essential to the product, universally useful, and has the potential for wide-reaching impact, it will be a part of the system. The system's value is ultimately measured by its ability to drive brand and product cohesiveness.

## GDS values

#### Inclusive

Consider diverse perspectives to get the best outcomes.

#### Intuitive

Make it easy to understand, leveling the playing field for everyone.

#### Impactful

Create a product so helpful that it makes people wonder how they worked without it.

#### Transparent

Work openly, welcome feedback, and share often.

#### Quality

Deliver best-in-class solutions regardless of how big or small the problem.

## Goals

#### Build higher-quality product offerings

Empowered teams create a more cohesive product with less time spent repeating UI patterns.

#### Create a shared foundation and language​

A shared language improves collaboration and creates a collective understanding of our product offerings for everyone.

#### Enable strategy over details​

Providing foundations, components, patterns, and documentation frees up time to focus on the user experience.
