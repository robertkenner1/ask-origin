# Contributing to GDS

We welcome and greatly appreciate contributions to GDS! Listed below are the resources and guidelines for contributing.

## Adding a component in code

If you wish to add a component to GDS, follow the steps below:

1. Discuss the potential contribution with the GDS team in [#gds-support](https://app.slack.com/client/E06GHNPFX4L/C03MNHYDT5E)
2. Read the [contribution process guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4_Cqo_siEDr7NtJknb_YTSvnWD-flLisUA72WrHxnY/edit#heading=h.wlcpn9oii4kl)
3. Write a schema doc based on [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rq7s-HBxPbie-cUAdS25AVaFLNN75u87jOIN0ktKYSw/edit#heading=h.d72vdubtjukt)
4. Once the schema is written, share for review in #gds-support
5. After the schema is approved, [development begins](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4_Cqo_siEDr7NtJknb_YTSvnWD-flLisUA72WrHxnY/edit#bookmark=id.ygk820dkei5x)!

Always feel free to ask questions along the way!

## Updating a current component

If you'd like to add a new variation of a component that's already implemented in code, or you find a bug you'd like to fix, please reach out in [#gds-support](https://app.slack.com/client/E06GHNPFX4L/C03MNHYDT5E) and the GDS team will help coordinate your update.

## Proposing a new component design

If you would like to propose a new component candidate for GDS, please join [Office Hours](/support/#office-hours) to discuss your use case and provide context.

You can also view our current [Candidates for GDS](https://airtable.com/appUcCifv84bK3gJo/tblUb1ymkZIjPBAtR/viwH7jKcw6WyXKUp9?blocks=hide) list to see if others have made a similar request.
Successful component candidates will:

- Solve a problem that can’t be solved with an existing component or pattern
- Scale to fit different use cases in the product
- Meet accessibility standards
- Use GDS Foundations styles
- Be designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for future updates and improvements without major changes to the system
