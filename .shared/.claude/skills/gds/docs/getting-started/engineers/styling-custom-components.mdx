# Styling Custom Components with GDS

## Do you need a custom component?

It’s easy to tell if you can rely on the design system or if you need to build a custom component.

<img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/getting-started/engineers/gds_decision_tree.png")}
    alt="."
    onclick="this.requestFullscreen()"
/>

If a component matches most of your requirements but not all, reach out on Slack at [#gds-support](https://grammarly.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03MNHYDT5E). We can help update that component as needed or, in some cases, give you tips on how to cover the gaps with CSS styling.

You can also reach out to a Product Designer to see if there’s flexibility to align the proposed design to GDS standards.

If you land on creating a custom component, reach out to GDS and clarify your use case before starting any work. We’ll let you know if something similar is already on our roadmap, or help you evaluate how to meet our accessibility standards.

## Why are custom components useful?

GDS aspires to cover as many needs as possible for teams to build product UI, but sometimes custom components are beneficial. There are some common reasons:

- You need a component that’s on the GDS roadmap, but it won’t be built in time for your particular launch.
- You need a component that isn’t on the GDS roadmap, and we don’t have a timeline for when it will be available.
- You need a component that is too specific to be part of the design system.

While building something twice is not ideal, it may be the best way to ensure a product ships on time. The GDS team needs enough time to build an ideal experience that can live as a reusable part of our design system. Similarly, GDS maintains components that can be applied in multiple scenarios, so extremely unique components will likely not be included in the system.

No matter the reason for creating a custom component, we rely on you to take care that all components still match Grammarly’s visual style and follow accessibility best practices. GDS offers design tokens, typography, and utility components to help you do that.

## Creating custom components

If you have confirmed with the GDS team that a custom component is truly the only option, there are a few approaches you can take.

### Use GDS primitive components

GDS offers primitive components that you can combine to create more complex components. Flex, Text, Heading, and Icon are usually all you need to create a component—or at least a solid foundation for one.

These components reference our [design tokens](https://designsystem.grammarly.io/foundations/tokens) and allow you to more easily maintain a consistent, accessible visual style for your custom component. This example of a card demonstrates how to use these utility components to achieve a specific goal.

Visit the [component documentation](/components) and [Storybook](https://uifoundation.gpages.io/grammarly-design-system/?path=/docs/gds-flex--docs) to browse examples that might spark inspiration for your use case.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Flex
      gap={6}
      direction="column"
      padding={4}
      width={400}
      borderColor="base-subdued"
      borderRadius={2}
    >
      <Flex gap={2} align="center" marginLeft={-1}>
        <Icon icon={OutcomeCorrectnessIcon} size="medium" accessibilityLabel="Correctness Category" />
        <Text variant="text-small" as="p">Correctness</Text>
        <Text variant="text-small" as="span">‧</Text>
        <Text variant="text-small" as="p">Capitalize the word</Text>
        <IconButton
          accessibilityLabel="Details about this correction"
          icon={InterfaceInfoIcon}
          variant="tertiary"
          onClick={() => {}}
        />
      </Flex>
      <Flex gap={1}>
        <ScreenReaderOnly>delete "today (spelling t o d a y)"</ScreenReaderOnly>
        <Text variant="text-medium" as="p" decoration="line-through">today</Text> 
        <ScreenReaderOnly>insert "Today (spelling capital T o d a y)"</ScreenReaderOnly>
        <Text as="p" weight="bold">Today</Text> is a great day!
      </Flex>
      <Flex justify="space-between" align="center" gap={4} marginLeft={-2}>
        <Button variant="tertiary" text="Previous" accessibilityLabel="Back to previous step" />
        <Text as="p" variant="text-small">
          3 of 6<ScreenReaderOnly>Suggestions</ScreenReaderOnly>
        </Text>
        <Button text="Next" accessibilityLabel="Next step" />
      </Flex>
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

### Style third-party components

:::caution Before beginning this process:

Reach out to GDS and clarify your use case. We’ll let you know if something similar is already on our roadmap, or help you evaluate how to meet our accessibility standards.
:::

For complex components, it may be advantageous to start with a third-party component and style it using GDS design tokens to match Grammarly’s visual language.

**We strongly recommend using [React Aria hooks](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/hooks.html) as your base whenever possible.** React Aria is already included in many of our repositories. Using this library helps to create a more accessible component; however, you will still need to review your component with our accessibility team.

You will use React Aria's class names to apply GDS styling through tokens. The tokens are how you ensure the colors, borders, spacing, and typography are consistent with other parts of the Grammarly product.

### Examples

#### Breadcrumbs

The Breadcrumb component from React Aria has smaller font sizes and different colors than we use at Grammarly. It also doesn't follow our styling for underlines on Links.

<ComponentPlayground
    hideCodePreview
    scope={{BreadcrumbsReactAriaDemo}}
    code={`   
    <div>
        <Text as="p" variant="text-large">
            React Aria default Breadcrumbs 
        </Text>
        <BreadcrumbsReactAriaDemo/>
    </div>
    `}
/>

<br/>
By applying GDS tokens to change the typography, text decoration, and color, it becomes harmonious with other components in our design system.

   <ComponentPlayground
    scope={{BreadcrumbsExample}}
    code={`  
    function ExampleContent() {
    const styles = \`
    .custom-breadcrumb-list-item {
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        gap: var(--space-1);
        text-decoration-thickness: 1.5px;
        text-underline-offset: var(--space-1);
    }

    .custom-breadcrumb-list-item-active {
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-decoration-color: var(--color-border-brand-default);
    }
    
    .custom-breadcrumb-list-item-active:hover {
        text-decoration-line: underline;
        text-decoration-thickness: max(1.5px, 0.0625rem);
    }
    ;\`

    return <div>
        <style>{styles}</style>
        <Text as="p" variant="text-large">
            React Aria Breadcrumbs styled with GDS tokens
        </Text>
        <BreadcrumbsExample/>
    </div>}
    `}
    />


#### TreeView

Another example of a third-party component is TreeView.

Notice how the styling changes the overall look and usability in the before and after. The original component is compact, has no icons, and uses Arial font for text. In the GDS version, we’ve applied Grammarly’s visual design language across icons, color, font, spacing, and borders.


<div className="content-best-practice">
  <Flex wrap gap={4} direction="column" align="start">
    <Flex align="center" direction="row" gap={1}>
      <Icon icon={InterfaceRemoveIcon} accessibilityLabel="" variant="critical" size="large" />
      <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">Off-brand</Heading>
    </Flex>
      <img
        src={useBaseUrl("/img/getting-started/engineers/custom_styling_treeview_dont.png")}
        alt="A TreeView component with small fonts and no GDS styling."
      />


    </Flex>
    <Flex wrap gap={4} direction="column" align="start">
      <Flex align="center" direction="row" gap={1}>
        <Icon icon={InterfaceOkIcon} accessibilityLabel="" size="large" />
        <Heading as="h4" variant="heading-small">On-brand</Heading>
      </Flex>
        <img

          src={useBaseUrl("/img/getting-started/engineers/custom_styling_treeview_do.png")}
          alt="The same TreeView styled with GDS, including rounded border and colors from the palette."
        />
  </Flex>
</div>

Example TreeView CSS using GDS Tokens
```css 
ul.tree {
    border: 0.5px solid var(--neutral-gray-40);
    border-radius: var(--radius-1);
    padding: var(--space-4);
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 500px;
}

.treeItem > div:hover {
    border: 1px solid var(--neutral-gray-40);
    border-radius: var(--radius-1);
    background-color: var(--neutral-gray-5);
}

.label {
    padding-left: var(--space-1);
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    font-family: var(--font-stack-inter);
}

:global(.MuiTreeItem-root div.Mui-focused),
:global(.MuiTreeItem-root div.Mui-selected),
:global(.MuiTreeItem-root div.Mui-selected.Mui-focused) {
    border: 1px solid var(--neutral-gray-40);
    border-radius: var(--radius-1);
    background-color: var(--neutral-gray-0) !important;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

## What you need to know

We recognize that custom components will always be needed. However, keep in mind that custom components are a last resort.

GDS components are thoroughly tested, documented, and maintained. By creating a custom component, you assume responsibility for its quality and upkeep.

When a custom component is your only option, we will provide you with the tools you need to create consistent, accessible components that blend seamlessly into the rest of Grammarly’s product.

If you have any questions or want to discuss a solution, reach out on Slack at [#gds-support](https://grammarly.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03MNHYDT5E) or sign up for our [Office Hours](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/15jCsFnAvQIQmzlFftND5R5SoxY-b5T9WJJNQf7pKOB8/edit).
