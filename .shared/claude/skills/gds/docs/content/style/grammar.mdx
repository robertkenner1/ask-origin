# Grammar

**Grammar** means the system of language rules that allows us to combine individual words to make complex meanings. This section is organized alphabetically and applies to content in product UI.

For a full breakdown of Grammarly’s approach to grammar and usage in other external-facing content, visit the <Link href="https://coda.io/d/Grammarly-Style-Guide_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarly-Style-Guide_suVxisx4">Grammarly Company Style Guide</Link>.

## Contractions

In most cases, use contractions for a warmer, more conversational tone. 

Do not use contractions when we want to draw special attention to a direction—for instance, when a user is about to do something that cannot be undone. Notice in the examples below how writing “will not” in full emphasizes the irreversible impact of the action.

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "You’re welcome!",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "You are welcome.",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: true,
      content: "You will not be able to undo this action.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "You won’t be able to undo this action.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Prepositions

It _is_ OK to end sentences with prepositions. Doing so actually allows for a more conversational, human tone. Adhering to the overly formal grammar rule of _not_ ending sentences with prepositions would result in writing that feels way too stiff and academic. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Who are you writing for?",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "For whom are you writing?",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

**Note:** When writing about where to find items in a menu, we prefer the preposition “in.” For example, “In the **File** menu, select **New**.”

## Pronouns

Generally, see if you can write a sentence without pronouns. If pronouns are necessary, avoid using both first person and second person in the same sentence, paragraph, or piece of content, as that can confuse a user.

## Verb tenses

Generally, if the simple present makes sense, use it. Depending on context, you might use the simple past or simple future tenses, too. These make sentences clearer and easier to understand. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Clarity: Helps make your writing easier to understand",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Clarity: Will be helping to make your writing easier to be understood",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "You addressed 32 issues!",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "You're addressing 32 issues!",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Use imperative verbs in Button labels to put a user in control of the action. [Learn more about writing Button labels](/components/button#writing).

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Apply suggestion",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Suggestion needs to be applied",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

Avoid the progressive tense unless there’s a specific reason to show something in progress or in motion. Usually, verbs ending in _-ing_ are not the best option for UI text. 

<DoDontList
  items={[
    {
      content: "Saving changes …",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "Change save in progress …",
      type: "dont",
    },
    {
      spaceAbove: "true",
      content: "Update your settings",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      content: "In this section, you will be updating your settings.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>
