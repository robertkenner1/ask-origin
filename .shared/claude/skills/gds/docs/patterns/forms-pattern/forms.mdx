# Forms

A Form is a combination of inputs that collect information. [View the available Form components.](/components/form)

## Usage

Use when collecting structured data from a user, such as personal information or preferences. A Form is flexible so that it can be used in many contexts, such as sign-ups, settings, item creation, and item editing.

Check with your engineering team to understand the back-end infrastructure so you can choose inputs that align with the specific functionality.

## Anatomy

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/components/forms_anatomy.svg")} alt="Anatomy diagram of a Form" />
</div>
<ol class="diagram-legend small">
  <li>Form heading</li>
  <li>Heading description</li>
  <li>Label (can include Optional or Required indicator)</li>
  <li>Text field</li>
  <li>Fieldset legend (can include Optional or Required indicator)</li>
  <li>Legend description</li>
  <li>Fieldset</li>
  <li>Primary Button</li>
</ol>

## Building blocks

### Fieldsets and legends

#### Usage

Use a [Fieldset](/components/form#with-a-fieldset) to group closely related inputs. Always use a legend to label the set and style the legend in **Text Small Bold**.

<div class="diagram p-8">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/forms_fieldset_example.svg")}
    alt="A Fieldset groups related inputs, such as the day, month, and year of a birth date, while a legend clearly labels the set."
  />
</div>
<p class="caption">
  A Fieldset groups related inputs, such as the day, month, and year of a birth date, while a legend
  clearly labels the set.
</p>

#### Required or Optional indicator

The Fieldset legend can include an “(Optional)” or a “(Required)” indicator. If the majority of the Fieldsets are one type, mark only the outliers.

If a user can add a large amount of optional information, we recommend creating a dedicated Fieldset for it. Mark the Fieldset legend as “(Optional)”, rather than individual input labels, to avoid excessive repetition.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/forms_optional_section.svg"),
      caption: `The entire shipping address is optional, so the inputs are grouped in a Fieldset with a legend marked as “(Optional)”.`,
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Writing

Fieldset legends help a user scan the sections of a Form. A legend should clearly describe the entire set of inputs.

<RecommendationsTable
  caption="Writing best practices for Fieldset legends"
  recommendations={[
    {
      recommendationDo:
        "Keep the writing structure and verb tense consistent within the entire Form.",
      exampleDo: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/fieldset_writing_DO_1.svg")}
          alt="2 fieldsets are shown with parallel style in the legend text - Shipping address and Billing address."
        />
      ),
      recommendationDont: "Do not mix writing structures or verb tenses within a Form.",
      exampleDont: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/fieldset_writing_DONT_1.svg")}
          alt="2 fieldsets are shown with mis-matching style in the legend text - Shipping address and then Enter your billing address, too."
        />
      ),
    },
    {
      recommendationDo: "Use sentence case.",
      exampleDo: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/fieldset_writing_DO_2.svg")}
          alt="A fieldset legend written in sentence case, Assign shortcuts, where only the first letter of the first word is capitalized."
        />
      ),
      recommendationDont: "Do not use Title Case or ALL CAPS.",
      exampleDont: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/fieldset_writing_DONT_2.svg")}
          alt="A fieldset legend written in all caps, ASSIGN SHORTCUTS."
        />
      ),
    },
    {
      recommendationDo: "Use internal punctuation when necessary.",
      exampleDo: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/fieldset_writing_DO_3.svg")}
          alt="A fieldset legend has a hyphen in it, which is an example of internal punctuation."
        />
      ),
      recommendationDont: "Do not use end punctuation, except for question marks in some cases.",
      exampleDont: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/fieldset_writing_DONT_3.svg")}
          alt="A fieldset legend has an exclamation point at the end, which is discouraged along with periods."
        />
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

### Labels

#### Accessibility

Use a persistent label on all components in a Form.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/text_field_do.svg"),
      caption: "Always pair a Form input, like Text Field, with a persistent label.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/text_field_dont.svg"),
      caption: "Do not use a nonpersistent label or shrinking label inside a Form input.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

In rare cases when surrounding text acts as the label of an input, the input’s label can be hidden, typically with the `labelDisplay` prop.

<ComponentPlayground
  code={`
    <Flex align="center" gap={4} width={400}>
      <TextSmall children="View snippet list"/>
      <TextField labelDisplay="hidden" label="Shortcut to view snippet list" defaultValue="/\"/>
    </Flex>
  `}
/>

#### Required or Optional indicator

If the majority of the inputs are one type, mark only the inputs for outliers.

Try to limit the occurrence of optional inputs. When the majority of the inputs are optional, mark any required inputs with “(Required)”. Do not mark optional inputs as “(Optional)”.

When the majority of the inputs are required, mark any optional inputs with “(Optional)”. Also include a note at the top of the form indicating that the other, unmarked inputs are required.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/forms_optional.svg"),
      caption: `Only one input is required, so it is marked as “(Required)”. The others are understood to be optional.`,
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/forms_required.svg"),
      caption: `The page subheading indicates all fields are required. The only optional input is marked as “(Optional)”.`,
      type: "do",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Writing

Labels help a user scan the various inputs in a Form. A label should describe the purpose of an individual input while clearly distinguishing each input from one another.

  caption="Writing best practices for input labels"
  recommendations={[
    {
      recommendationDo:

        />
      ),
    },
    {
      recommendationDo:

          alt="A Checkbox’s label reads Show labels entirely, even long ones. Helper text says A little helper text can go a long way. It demonstrates showing all of the text for a long label."
        />
      ),
      recommendationDont: "Do not truncate a label.",
      exampleDont: (
        <img
          src={useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/label_writing_DONT_4.svg")}
          alt="A Checkbox’s label is shown truncated without all of the text content. It says Show long labels in their enti … but the end of the phrase is unfinished."
        />
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

### Helper text

#### Usage

Use helper text to provide instructions, indicate requirements, offer an example, or define a technical term used in a label.

If you’re questioning whether a label is unclear, you may want to add helper text.

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/Helper_usage_DO.svg"),
      caption: "Use helper text to add meaning or additional information.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/patterns/Helper_usage_DONT.svg"),
      caption: "Do not use helper text to repeat or summarize a label.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Writing

Helper text takes different forms to fit specific needs. Some tell the user what to do with action verbs, while others define terms and requirements with punchy fragments of information.

<RecommendationsTable
  caption="Writing best practices for helper text"
  recommendations={[
    {

### Placeholder text

#### Usage

In general, do not use placeholder text. To convey information necessary for understanding how to fill in a input, use helper text that is accessible to a screen reader. [Learn how to write helper text](#helper-text).

<Recommendations
  recommendations={[
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/text_field_placeholder_do.svg"),
      caption: "Use placeholder text rarely and only for nonessential information.",
      type: "do",
    },
    {
      image: useBaseUrl("/img/components/text_field_placeholder_dont.svg"),
      caption:
        "Do not use placeholder text for information necessary for understanding a Text Field or Area.",
      type: "dont",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Accessibility

We advise against using placeholder text because it is not reliably read aloud by screen readers. This can deprive a person with a vision disability from receiving content considered important enough to include.

Accessibility improvements are often holistic design improvements that benefit all users. In this case, placeholder text presents a universal usability issue, as it disappears after a user starts to type. This can lead to a loss of information for all users, including but not limited to someone with a vision disability.

### Error messages

Errors, mistakes, and issues happen. But you can influence how often errors occur and even prevent them through savvy design practices and healthy cross-discipline collaboration.
