# Illustrations

Illustrations are used throughout our products to add a moment of brand expression and visual interest. They are most often used in [Empty States](/patterns/empty-state).

In code, all illustrations can be used through our [Illustration component](/components/illustration).

## Adding new illustrations

If there is no illustration in the system below that fits your need and you'd like to discuss an addition to the system, contact the Design Foundations team in the [#ask-origin-design-system Slack channel](https://grammarly.slack.com/archives/C03MNHYDT5E).

## Available illustrations

### Empty and Success states

Almost all of these illustrations are designed to be used in pairs. For example, an empty state with `empty-cookie` should be paired with a success state using `success-cookie`. `success-check` can be used wherever needed.

### Spot illustrations

These illustrations can be used anywhere as needed.
