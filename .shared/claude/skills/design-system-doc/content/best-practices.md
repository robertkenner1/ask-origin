# Best practices

Words mean unique things—each one of them. Wild, right? Language *is* kind of wild.

The right words can disambiguate components and pages from one another. They turn interactions and behavior into specific solutions. They draw attention to identifiable concepts that match a user’s wants and needs.

## Be concise

### Use simple sentences

Strive for simple sentence constructions. Avoid walls of text that require scrolling.

### Say only what matters most

Overexplanations tend to slow users down. Cut what’s unnecessary or excessive. A simple, condensed explanation is usually better than a complete but complex one.

### Consider the whole problem

If you feel you need an overly complex explanation or set of instructions, consider that this may indicate a design flaw. For instance, is your user flow as efficient as it could be?

## Be clear

### Set up content for scanning

Format and display information strategically. People often read by scanning, so make it easy for them.

### Write for 7th-grade readers

Assume your reader has a seventh-grade reading level and has the least possible context for what you’re trying to tell them. Is the text written so simply that it’s immediately understandable without any lengthy clarification?

### Prefer what's most familiar

Rely on existing concepts, terms, and words before inventing new ones to describe something. This helps us write simply and for the widest possible audience. Portmanteaus and neologisms often require larger investments in marketing and education to be understood by users. Remember to keep codenames confidential.

### Use technical terms strategically

Choose plain language over jargon but maintain technical terms strategically when they have specific meaning to the intended audience.

## Maintain our established style

### Use sentence case

Write in sentence case. It helps our users scan information at a glance.

### Be consistent

Apply a principle of consistency in lists, headings, and other parallel elements. Rewrite content so that the structure and punctuation are parallel.

### Use simple punctuation like periods

Reduce punctuation use when possible. Maintain end punctuation when it makes sense—for instance, to distinguish two sentences or fragments.

Try to use periods instead of semicolons, dashes, conjunctions, or anything else that makes sentence structure more complex.

### Be correct first, conversational second

Strike a balance between conversational writing and correct grammar. There is rarely a reason to break a grammar rule for the sake of sounding conversational. In most cases, bad writing is distracting, pulls readers out of the experience, and is also off-brand. There's likely a grammatically correct way to say what you need while not bending over backward to adhere to a rule.
