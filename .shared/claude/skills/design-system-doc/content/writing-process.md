# Writing process

The writing process is painfully non-linear.

You might start writing, then find you need research to understand a new problem. Doing that research could mean getting feedback from a peer about if you're asking the right question or to check the validity of information. After getting feedback, you might be ready to write a draft and quickly move on to editing.

Sometimes writing even looks like staring out of a window—lost in thought.

That is to say, there's no one correct process for writing. The different stages mentioned here are not meant to be exclusive, nor presented in chronological order.

These are, however, truly the juiciest morsels from Superhuman's Content Design team to help when you're stuck at different times while writing.

## Research

Define goals with your team: How will you know if your content is working? Learn about your audience's habits, needs, and expectations. Establish a vocabulary of terms that they know, use, and understand—this will help you determine the level of complexity you should aim for.

## Write

Start anywhere you can and start as soon as possible. It helps to start from a place of curiosity, too. Use the writing process to figure out what you know and what you need to learn more about (see: Research).

Forget what you think you know. Stretch your brain: Think spatially as well as verbally. Stretch your body, too. Then, keep writing. Embrace the idea of a very rough first draft. Sometimes it helps to write on paper (and it's harder to delete things this way).

## Get feedback

Get a second pair of eyes (or ears). Other people will see where the words aren't doing what they should be. They'll probably suggest ways to get you back on track, too. Our peers are much more forgiving than our users, so check in with them! It'd be a shame not to.

## Edit

Say what you wrote out loud. If it doesn't sound natural, change it. Identify the parts that get your point across and delete everything else. Start a new version that begins with the last line or boldest statement of your first draft. Revise until you build a bridge directly to the reader.
