# Terminology

The following words are relevant when writing for the Superhuman product experience. This list is continually updated. If you want to suggest a term or correct a mistake, reach out to the team in the #ask-origin-design-system Slack channel.

For the full word and term list, which incorporates even more language from an array of content spaces, visit our Superhuman Company Style Guide.

## A note about localization and international considerations

We write for the Superhuman product using American English spelling, grammar, and formatting for text and numbers. Although a user’s writing *is* corrected by Grammarly Proofreader agent based on the dialect of English they choose, the rest of the UI is not localized into either English dialects or other languages. Learn about localization and internationalization.

Despite this, it’s important to consider how machine or AI translations by third-party apps and browser extensions could affect our product. For example, certain browser extensions can translate text in UI from English into a different language.

To compensate for this and maximize comprehension:

* Use consistent terminology when applicable
* Write in American English with American formatting
* Apply standards from Origin and the [Company Brand Style Guide](https://coda.io/d/Superhuman-Style-Guide_dNw1zZnMEND/Grammarlys-Plans_su4UNXs7#_luHT-uoI)

Keep global political perspectives front of mind when writing for the product. Grammarly’s audience is, in part, people who learn English as a second language. Look for what could be misunderstood and edit it for complete clarity.

## Term list

Terms are in alphabetical order. Use ⌘ + f or ctrl + f to search for a term on this page.

### A

**advanced** — do not use as a category or classification for suggestions, mistakes, features, or settings.

* Use “Premium” to describe the suggestions or features available only to paying subscribers
* Avoid describing a writing mistake as “advanced” to avoid sounding unnecessarily judgmental

Reframe content from a user's perspective—would they call this feature or option “advanced?” Probably not unless it is a truly groundbreaking revolution like AI. There is likely a clearer, more accurate, and more descriptive term you could use to describe something instead of calling it “advanced.” While it's a good UX practice to tuck away options that aren’t meant for all users, it isn’t necessary to highlight that we view these features as more technical, more complicated, or more tedious than others.

**AI-powered** — do not use.

### C

**choose (verb)** — reserve use for when guiding a user to make a very personal choice. In some cases, “choose” or “select” may work equally well, and “select” is recommended as the preferred verb in instructional text. See also: “select.”

**click (use) vs. click on (do not use)** — use “click” by itself instead of “click on.” Click is an affordance for pointing devices (mice, trackpads), usually associated with a PC or tablet interface. If not referring specifically to a desktop interface, consider using the preferred action verb “select” instead.

**corrections** — avoid for the most part; refer to what Grammarly provides as “suggestions” in order to drive home that the user is in charge of their writing.

**country** — do not use as a label for a list of geographic locales. Instead, use “country or region” or simply “location,” as appropriate.

### D

**delete** — use for an action that is permanent. Do not use for reversible actions, instead use “remove.” For example, you would “remove” a user from a group because it is possible to re-add them again later. Also use “remove” for actions done to a person or other sentient being—you can delete a person’s account, but you can’t delete them.

**disable / disabled** — do not use *disable* or *disabled* in user-facing content. For example, do not use when referring to something being:

* “inactive,” like a button in the `isDisabled` state. To learn how we write about the `isDisabled` attribute in Origin docs, [visit our doc writing conventions](/getting-started/contributing/writing-conventions#inclusive-language-and-the-isdisabled-attribute).
* “unavailable,” like a feature that’s having a temporary issue
* “turned off,” like a feature controlled by a switch
* “discontinued,” like a feature that has been removed from the product

Use the examples below as a starting point for writing around these words. The Superhuman Company Style Guide has even richer guidance about inclusive language. If you feel like you need to use *disable* or *disabled* as a technical term in customer-facing product UI, first check in with a content designer via #ama-content-design on Slack.

**download (verb)** — not transformative. Refers to changing the location of an artifact from remote to local. For example, downloading a copy of a file from a cloud server. See also: “export.”

### E

**enable** — use with caution. “Enable” may be OK in rare cases, but there’s likely a way to sound warmer and more casual. Do not create a state where “enable” and “disable” exist as opposing actions. Instead, use “turn on and off,” “activate and deactivate,” or similar synonyms. See also: “disable.”

**error, errors** — avoid using “error” in reference to a user’s writing or action. “Error” has a negative connotation and we want to avoid sounding judgmental. In general, we are careful to avoid language that could make a user feel blamed for an issue or mistake.

In the case of codes needed for support agents, it is OK to use “Error:” followed by an alphanumeric code. [Learn how to write error messages](/docs/patterns/forms-pattern/forms/#writing-3).

**export (verb)** — transformative. Refers to taking a set of data out of its native format and creating a version in a different format, often for use by a different app. For example, exporting an asset from an .svg file to .png or exporting web data to an .xls spreadsheet. See also: “download.”

### G

**got it** — do not use. Find more neutral, and when possible, descriptive language. Possible alternatives based on context include: accept, back, cancel, close, dismiss, done, OK. [Learn about writing Button labels](/components/button#writing).

### H

**hit (verb)** — do not use to instruct customers how to interact with the product or their devices. Although this is a very common colloquial expression, there are many other words that mean the same thing and that do not suggest violent action. See also: “select” and “choose.”

### I

**invalid** — do not use. Avoid words like *invalid* or *disabled* because of their alternate meanings in healthcare. See also: “disable.”

It’s generally not helpful to tell a user that something they’ve done or possess is "invalid,” “broken,” or “wrong.” Instead, reframe content to focus on how a user can move forward.

For example, the error message “Invalid email” seems unnecessarily harsh and feels like a closed door. Instead, try using a message like “Check the spelling of your email address,” which gives clear instructions that invite a user to move forward.

**import (verb)** — transformative. Refers to taking a set of preformatted data from another app for use in the current app or context. For example, importing an image. See also: “upload.”

### L

**log in (verb)** — do not use. See: “sign in,” which is preferred.

### M

**members** — in Grammarly Business contexts, refer to members, not company members.

**menu, in** — use “in” instead of “on” to refer to menu actions.

**monitor** — do not use when describing how users interact with the Grammarly Business product, or how account owners can view or measure team members’ engagement with the product. Instead, use synonyms with a more positive connotation: measuring improvements, finding opportunities, measuring engagement, or other synonyms. See also: “tracks.”

### P

**password (and related verbs)** — be mindful of the subtle yet important distinctions between verbs commonly used with “password.” In particular, the verbs: change, create, reset, and update. Do not use them interchangeably.

* **change** password — refers to changing a password from an existing value to a new value.
* **create** password — refers to setting the initial value of a password during onboarding or, in some cases, when the required password format for an app or site has changed.
* **reset** password — refers to erasing an existing password and creating a new one usually because the existing password has expired, been lost, or forgotten.
* **update** password — refers to overwriting a stored password with the new value of a password that was set in a different context. For example, if one changes their email password via a web interface, they must also update it in their email client.

**please** — limit use in UI content as it’s usually not needed. In fact, unnecessary overuse of “please” can create concierge syndrome. In product content, repetition and empty phrases are likely to be glossed over. Reserve for use in frustrating contexts such as error messages. Acceptable in multi-sentence situations to soften tone and not sound too commanding.

**pop-up (adjective)** — write “pop-up” as one hyphenated word in the phrase “pop-up window” or when modifying other nouns.

**pop up (verb)** — use a space when written as a verb meaning to appear suddenly.

**press (keyboard shortcut combination)** — for keyboard shortcut instructions, use “press” instead of “type.”

**protect** — use with caution when making product claims about protection. Instead use “helps protect.” Note that any claims about product security should be reviewed by Comms and Legal teams.

### R

**remove** — use for reversible actions. Do not use for permanent actions, instead use “delete.” For example, you would “remove” a user from a group because it is possible to re-add them again later. Also use “remove” for actions done to a person or other sentient being—you can delete a person’s account, but you can’t delete them.

### S

**secure** — use with caution when making product claims about security. Instead use “helps secure.” Note that any claims about product security should be reviewed by Comms and Legal teams.

**select (verb)** — preferred action verb for instructional text in UI. See also: “choose.”

**sign in (verb)** — write as two words; no hyphen unless used as a modifier before a noun. “Sign in” is preferred over “log in.”

**sign in to (verb)** — write phrase as three words.

**sign up (verb)** — write phrase as two words. When “sign in” and “sign up” appear on the same page, consider changing “sign up” to “create an account” to avoid confusion.

**sorry** — only use in UI content for frustrating or difficult contexts such as error messages. Overuse can come across as insincere or annoying.

**suggestions** — be clear that Grammarly generates suggestions—it does not “find” them. Grammarly finds or detects issues after scanning text.

**swipe** —  use to describe the act of moving a finger across a touchscreen to activate a function. If not referring specifically to this interaction on a touch device, consider using another, generic verb, such as “select” or “choose.”

**switch (verb)** — do not use “switch” as a verb when guiding a user how to interact with UI. Instead, use language that identifies turning an option on or off. [Learn why in the Switch component documentation](/components/switch/#referring-to-state-changes). See also: “toggle.”

### T

**toggle** — do not use “toggle” as a noun or verb when describing UI or guiding a user how to interact with UI. Avoid using the verb “switch” in this context, too. Instead, use language that identifies turning an option on or off.

Both “toggle” and “switch” may be fine in other contexts. If you aren’t sure, ask a Content Designer in #ama-content-design on Slack.

**track, tracking** — do not use. More generally, avoid language that implies we are tracking or monitoring people’s personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data. Exceptions include when we are notifying the customer about our practices, as in our Trust Guidelines. Note that any language around tracking should be reviewed by Comms and Legal teams.

**turn off for** — use this phrase, rather than “turn off on” or “turn off in,” to describe switching features on or off for a website or app.

### U

**unpause (verb)** — do not use. Although “unpausing” (adj.) is a word, “unpause” (v.) and “unpaused” (adj.) are not (as of yet). Instead, use another word, such as “resume” or “play,” that puts action in positive terms and names what is being resumed.

**unlock (verb)** — do not use when referring to upgrading to Premium. It’s not the most precise or accurate way to describe that change, even though some marketing copy might employ this word. See: “upgrade.”

**upgrade (verb)** — preferred action to describe signing up for a Premium account. Other acceptable verbs include “get” and “go”. Avoid “update” and “unlock” in this context.

**upload (verb)** — not transformative. Refers to changing the location of an artifact from local to remote. For example, uploading a file from a computer to a website. See also: “import.”

**username** — write as one word, per Merriam-Webster.

### W

**widget** — use to describe the in-product entry point that opens the expanded assistant interface. The widget appears as a G logomark by default but changes appearance when suggestions are available. [Learn about the widget pattern](/patterns/grammarly-widget/).
