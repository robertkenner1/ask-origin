# Grammar

**Grammar** means the system of language rules that allows us to combine individual words to make complex meanings. This section is organized alphabetically and applies to content in product UI.

For a full breakdown of Superhuman's approach to grammar and usage in other external-facing content, visit the Superhuman Company Style Guide.

## Contractions

In most cases, use contractions for a warmer, more conversational tone.

Do not use contractions when we want to draw special attention to a direction—for instance, when a user is about to do something that cannot be undone. Notice in the examples below how writing “will not” in full emphasizes the irreversible impact of the action.

## Prepositions

It *is* OK to end sentences with prepositions. Doing so actually allows for a more conversational, human tone. Adhering to the overly formal grammar rule of *not* ending sentences with prepositions would result in writing that feels way too stiff and academic.

**Note:** When writing about where to find items in a menu, we prefer the preposition “in.” For example, “In the **File** menu, select **New**.”

## Pronouns

Generally, see if you can write a sentence without pronouns. If pronouns are necessary, avoid using both first person and second person in the same sentence, paragraph, or piece of content, as that can confuse a user.

## Verb tenses

Generally, if the simple present makes sense, use it. Depending on context, you might use the simple past or simple future tenses, too. These make sentences clearer and easier to understand.

Use imperative verbs in Button labels to put a user in control of the action. [Learn more about writing Button labels](/components/button#writing).

Avoid the progressive tense unless there’s a specific reason to show something in progress or in motion. Usually, verbs ending in *-ing* are not the best option for UI text.
