# Content

Use these resources when writing within the Superhuman product. Our in-product guidelines are a constrained version of Superhuman's overall Company Style Guide—reflecting the needs of designing highly usable experiences.

Our goal is for you to feel confident about maintaining a consistent brand voice and style within our product. You’re in the right place if you’re wondering things like:

* **[Style](/content/style):** Do we use numerals (1,2,3) or spell out numbers (one, two, three) in UI?
* **[Terminology](/content/terminology):** Does a “suggestion” or “correction” fix a “mistake” or an “issue?”
* **[Naming](/content/terminology/#product-and-feature-names):** What do we call Grammarly’s entry point on Mac and Windows?
* **[Voice and tone](/content/voice-and-tone):** How do we speak to users, and who is Superhuman's audience?

If you have a question about a piece of guidance or want to know something that isn’t included, reach out in #ama-content-design.

If you’re writing content outside of the product—marketing copy in ads and emails, landing pages, blogs, social media posts, or support documentation—visit the Superhuman Company Style Guide on Confluence.
