# Glossary

Below are some key terms we use when talking about the Origin design system.

## Principles

Guiding principles to help us work in a consistent and purposeful way. [View our Origin principles](/about-origin#our-principles).

## Foundations

Visual elements like color, space, typography, and elevation that define our visual language across products and platforms. It also includes non-visual elements like accessibility and content standards that are fundamental to building our products. [View our Foundation guidelines](/foundations).

## Tokens

The coded representation of the design decisions found in the design system. These values include, but are not limited to, foundational elements. [View our design Tokens](/tokens).

## Components

Basic elements in an interface that are reusable across the product. These include simple elements, like Buttons, or more complex elements, like Modal, that are built from a group of simpler elements. [View our Components](/components).

## Patterns

A reusable solution to a common design problem. For example, common, reusable form layouts using individual form components. [View our Pattern guidelines](/patterns).

## Templates

A larger concept that comprises a whole layout of a page. Landing pages may follow a common template.

## Partners

We consider anyone who uses and/or contributes to Origin a partner. We aim to partner with teams to produce a design system that reflects their diverse perspectives, needs, and areas of expertise.
