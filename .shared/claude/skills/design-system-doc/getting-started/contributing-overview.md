## Updating a current component

If you'd like to add a new variation of a component that's already implemented in code, or you find a bug you'd like to fix, please reach out in [#ask-origin-design-system](https://app.slack.com/client/E06GHNPFX4L/C03MNHYDT5E) and the Origin team will help coordinate your update.

## Proposing a new component design

If you would like to propose a new component candidate for Origin, please join [Office Hours](/support/#office-hours) to discuss your use case and provide context.

Successful component candidates will:

* Use Origin Foundations styles
* Be designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for future updates and improvements without major changes to the system
