# Popover

A Popover displays rich content in context.

## Usage

Popovers respond to a user with nice-to-know information in context. A user should get an obvious, immediate benefit from the information in the Popover—otherwise, they'll likely ignore it.

**Use when:**

- A user's action activates a tidbit of nice-to-know, but not essential, information.
- Highlighting up to three UI elements, such as when introducing a new feature.
- Displaying low- to medium-priority information.
- An illustration or descriptive text is helpful to clarify a UI element's purpose.

**Do not use when:**

- Explaining a familiar, expected, or standard interaction, such as how to fill in a Form field. Instead, omit the unnecessary instructions.
- A user would benefit from persistent, visible instructions essential to completing a task. Instead, use plain UI text.
- Displaying a short, inline description of an element's purpose. Instead, use a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip).
- A robust procedure or an image of UI is needed to explain an interaction. Instead, use a [Modal](/components/modal) or [Link](/components/link) to a help center article.
