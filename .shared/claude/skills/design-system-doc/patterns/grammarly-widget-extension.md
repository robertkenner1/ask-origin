## Position

When Grammarly is running and checking text, the widget is fixed in the lower-right corner of most websites' writing surfaces.

In Google Docs, the widget is fixed in the lower-right corner of the full browser window. Though it won't get in the way of the writing surface, it may overlap some other Google Docs elements, like comments.
