# Pro plan branding

Defines how Pro plan branded UI elements are displayed in the product.

**Pro plan upsell:** In this example, the Pro branding elements are the gold V-bar, underlines, star icon, and CTA button.

## Brand Elements

### Star Icon

A `gold-40` or `neutral-gray-100` filled star icon is used to represent Pro plans. For further guidance see the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.

**Pro plan promo email:** In this example, the Pro branding elements are the Sticker with the 50% off discount and the Pro Tag.

## Best Practices

### Star Icon

#### Never overuse star icon

Do not overuse the star icon in small spaces, such as UI cards. In the example, the suggestion card with one star draws attention
to the banner, while the suggestion card with two stars competes for attention.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ![Do use the star icon to create hiererarchy and draw attention to the Pro content.](/img/patterns/pro_star_do-1.svg)<br/>Do use the star icon to create hierarchy and draw attention to the Pro content. | ![Do not use multiple star icons in small spaces where they start to compete.](/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-1.svg)<br/>Do not use multiple star icons in small spaces where they start to compete. |

#### Always pair star icon with name

The star icon should always be paired with the Pro or Grammarly Pro plan name. The example without the plan name has no context for what the icon means and may lead to confusion.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ![Do pair the star icon with the Pro and Grammarly Pro plan names.](/img/patterns/pro_star_do-2.svg)<br/>Do pair the star icon with the Pro and Grammarly Pro plan names. | ![Do not use the star icon without the plan names Pro or Grammarly Pro.](/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-2.svg)<br/>Do not use the star icon without the plan names Pro or Grammarly Pro. |

#### Always use correct color

Always use `gold-40` or `neutral-gray-100` when using this icon for Pro plan content. Using any other colors is considered off-brand.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ![Do use Origin tokens as a fill color for the Pro plan star icon.](/img/patterns/pro_star_do-3.svg)<br/>Do use Origin tokens as a fill color for the Pro plan star icon. | ![Do not use other colors as the fill color for the Pro plan star icon.](/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-3.svg)<br/>Do not use other colors as the fill color for the Pro plan star icon. |

### Button Color

Use the `background-pro-default` color for CTA buttons related to Pro.

| ![Do use the `background-pro-default` color for CTA buttons related to Pro plans.](/img/patterns/pro_star_do-4.svg)<br/>Do use the `background-pro-default` color for CTA buttons related to Pro plans. | ![Do not use colors from outside of the Pro color palette for CTA buttons related to Pro plans.](/img/patterns/pro_star_dont-4.svg)<br/>Do not use colors from outside of the Pro color palette for CTA buttons related to Pro plans. |

## UI Elements

### Color

The accent color, `gold-40`, is used solely for Pro branding in the product. It is important not to use this color for other elements, as it helps users quickly identify and understand the elements related to Pro plans.

The text color, `neutral-gray-100`, is used for copy and the star icon when placed on `gold-40` backgrounds.

### Underlines

Pro underlines and highlights appear over the user’s text when there are Pro suggestions. The same colors are used in both light and dark modes.

The Pro underline consists of two 1px borders using `gold-40` and `gold-60`. The `gold-60` underline ensures a 3:1 contrast while maintaining vibrancy and
the perception of a single underline. The highlight color is `gold-40` at 25% opacity.

!\[Pro underlines and highlights are shown on light mode and dark mode themes.]\(/img/patterns/pro\_plan\_UI\_elements-underlines.svg)

### V-bars

Pro V-bars have the same two-color treatment as underlines. The fill of the V-bar is `gold-40`, and the outer border is `gold-60`.

## Examples

### Pro Plan Upgrade Hook

This Pro plan upgrade hook (also known as locked UI) uses Pro colors for the highlight, underline, and CTA button. The gold star icon represents Pro as a visual element.
For more details on how to incorporate Pro branding into your design, see the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.

### Plans Page and Checkout Flow

In the Pro plan checkout flow, the CTA buttons use Pro colors for default and hover states from the Plans landing page through the payment details page.
