# Tokens

Tokens are the name and value pairs that store the Foundation visual styles used to create layouts
and components. When applied consistently to the product, we’re able to meaningfully apply design
decisions everywhere that customers experience Superhuman.

## Token implementation

It’s essential to apply tokens correctly to prevent any adverse effects in the future if a token's value changes. This means you shouldn’t use a border token as a background simply because it has the value you need. We strongly recommend working with a product designer or a Origin team member if you have questions about token usage in a specific context.

The design tokens are available as individual values in the Web (Javascript) library. To get started, follow the [installation instructions](/getting-started/engineers). Guidelines for integrating tokens on native platforms will be available soon.
